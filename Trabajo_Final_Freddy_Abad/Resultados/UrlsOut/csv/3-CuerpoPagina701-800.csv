	<strong>Story:<em> </em></strong>Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is the best of New York’s daredevil bicycle couriers. However, when he picks up an envelope for delivery on a ‘premium rush’ priority, he finds himself racing against more than just the clock.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Movie Review: </strong> While the plot and premise of Premium Rush is fairly simple and generic – the all-important message that must reach its intended recipient, come what may – this, for the most part, isn’t just a chase film. The dashing Wilee eschews a nine-to-five desk job for the sheer thrill of being a bicycle messenger with a death wish – dodging speeding vehicles, pedestrians and open doors along the way. As if to underscore his rebellious streak, Wilee rides fast, with no brakes on his sports bicycle. “Brakes are death,” he nonchalantly tells his estranged and concerned girlfriend Vanessa (Dania Ramirez), who is also a bike courier. She sees his wild streak as a hindrance to them having a secure future. After all, it would only take a split-second of misjudgment for him to meet with a fatal accident whilst riding.<br>
	<br>
	Small wonder then, that Gordon-Levitt needed 31 stitches in his right arm while filming the movie. Wilee’s also got competition, in the form of the muscular and almost comical Manny (Wolé Parks), who has his eye on Vanessa.</p>
<p>
	But this love triangle is put on the back-burner one day, when Nima (Jamie Chung) hands Wilee a small white envelope that must be delivered downtown by 7.30 pm, the very same day. Enter the menacing bad cop Bobby Monday (very convincingly played by Michael Shannon), who has a nasty gambling habit coupled with a single-minded,almost obsessive need to get his hands on that envelope.</p>
<p>
	Various jump cuts in the movie and cool map-style visuals help explain situations and embellish the story quite nicely. The conversations between Wilee and Vanessa however, as they zip, dodge and weave their way through traffic come across as unnecessary and cheesy. There’s the obligatory moral dilemma thrown in too. That aside, Premium Rush is fairly coherent, the bike stunts are cool and the film is filled with fast-paced chases that will often have you at the edge of your seat.</p>

	<strong>Story:<em> </em></strong><em>CIA exfiltration specialist Tony Mendez comes up with a plan to extract six American diplomats from Iran at a time when the Iranian public's ire against their overthrown Shah and the US is at its most volatile. Does Mendez succeed in fooling the Iranians into letting them go?</em><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Movie Review: </strong>The film starts with a history lesson on the politics of the region to bring you up to speed on why Iran still hates the USA. According to them, the USA is the Great Shaitan for first installing the Shah and then offering him asylum after his ouster.<br>
	<br>
	Set in the 1970s, <em>Argo</em> is based on the true story of the extraction of six diplomats from the Canadian ambassador's house, where they're hiding. As options are being considered, Mendez (Affleck) comes up with 'the best bad option by far' - the one with the least diplomatic fallout. If it succeeds, everyone's a winner; if it fails, everyone dies.<br>
	<br>
	The plan sounds deceptively simple. Make a fake movie, make Hollywood (and pretty much the rest of the world) believe that an award-winning director (Arkin) and make-up genius (Goodman) are attached to a sci-fi film called Argo, set in the Middle East. Create a media circus announcing the film and let the rest follow. Thereafter, Mendez enters the country on the ruse of location-scouting. He enters alone but has to leave with six other Americans posing as a Canadian crew. Easier said than done?<br>
	<br>
	Affleck's film is being seen as a serious Oscar contender and with good reason. The film doesn't favour one side over the other. Also, the dramatisation is not without its light moments. You will sense a fine balance and an acute attention to detailing, something that's pivotal to a film of this genre. Watch out for certain powerful crowd scenes and set pieces that grab you with their sheer intensity and absolute terror. You will gasp in awe at the pains taken in casting actors who resembled the actual players of this story the closest, as they are featured during the end credits.</p>

	<strong>Story: </strong><em>Retired CIA operative Bryan Mills and his ex-wife get kidnapped while holidaying in Istanbul. His daughter manages to escape. Will she be able to 'save' the couple?</em><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Movie Review:</strong> This sequel of 2008 hit Taken follows up a while after where the first film left off. Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is finding it tough coming to terms with the fact that his daughter Kim is seeing a boy and may be serious about him. The fact that she had been the recent victim of a kidnapping attempt foiled by her father is not lost on her. Father and daughter are still close and he wants nothing more than to ensure his family is safe. So, when his ex-wife Lenore complains about a cancelled trip, he consoles her and asks them to join him after 'work' (an assignment where he provides security to rich, high-risk clients) in Istanbul.<br>
	<br>
	Meanwhile, in faraway Albania, a village mourns at a mass burial. All the men dead at the hands of Bryan, punished for daring to kidnap his daughter and trying to sell her into prostitution. It is there that the main kidnapper's father Murad Krasniqi (Rade Serbedzija) vows to avenge his son and his men by capturing Mills and taking him back to his village for vengeance.<br>
	<br>
	As luck would have it, Lenore lands up in Instanbul with Kim and the family spends some quality time together. Their happiness is short-lived as Bryan and his ex-wife are chased and then 'taken' soon after. He manages to send out a call to his daughter at their hotel and warn her of the impending danger. He asks her to get to the safety of the US embassy but she insists on rescuing them. So he guides her to where they're being held. After that, it's a will-she won't-she affair?<br>
	<br>
	Screenwriter Luc Besson and director Olivier Megaton play to their strengths. Both have made films that have involved either abductions or high-octane action sequences and car chases. Liam Neeson mouths the cheesy lines and still sounds believable. If you're a fan of the actor or films with a similar storyline, you will enjoy this one. The car chases and the hand-to-hand fight scenes are not to be missed. Despite his bad-man act, Rade as Murad plays a convincing father driven mad by grief and your heart does reach out to him, never mind the evil he so clearly embodies. Also, this is one of those revenge flicks where you know how it could end but you'll strap on your seatbelt and go along for the ride anyway.</p>

	<strong>Story: </strong><em>Time travel is invented in the future but is soon made illegal. Misusing this system however, are mob bosses, who send their victims into the past to be shot by ‘loopers’, so that their very existence is wiped out. Trouble starts when a looper’s own future self is sent into the past to be killed…</em><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The film, set in the year 2044, opens with a bang (quite literally) where Joe (Gordon-Levitt with a considerable amount of makeup) shoots a victim sent back from the year 2074, with a blunderbuss in an empty field, collects the payment for his job — silver bars strapped to the bound and blindfolded victim’s back — and proceeds to party it up with his pals. This is a pattern that he keeps repeating day after day. A bachelor with a penchant for fine living, things go pretty smoothly for Joe. He shares his plans for early retirement in France with his stripper girlfriend Suzie (Piper Perabo), with the life of a paid assassin well behind him. Life is somewhat peachy, until a fellow looper Seth (Paul Dano) who failed to carry out his mission (an immediate death sentence for a looper) arrives at Joe’s apartment, begging for safe haven.<br>
	<br>
	What follows is a cascade of events, with not a wasted second. This is a future where some humans have evolved enough to have telekinesis (or ‘TK’ as it’s called in the movie) and events lead Joe to meet Sara (Emily Blunt), a tough country gal who knows her way around a shotgun. Joe’s older self (Bruce Willis) plays the tough guy very convincingly. Indeed, all the performances are very good.<br>
	<br>
	There are science fiction films that deal with the subject of time travel and then there is Looper, which comes across as refreshingly original as well as entertaining, with a story full of interesting twists. Notwithstanding the flash and slick visuals, director Rian Johnson always keeps the storyline to the fore. Events are explained in a fairly simple manner as the plot smoothly unfolds. The film will leave you satisfied and entertained after one watch. And there’s a pretty good chance you’d want to watch it again.</p>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>When a rich-boy poker game gets robbed, hit-man Jackie Cogan hunts those involved - what does Jackie mean by killing them softly?</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong><em> Killing Them Softly</em> (<em>KTS</em>) isn't a movie for the faint-hearted - but despite its guns and gore, it isn't an all-out action flick either. Instead, it inhabits a shadowy half-land between thriller and dark comedy, where wanna-be gangsters wear washing-up gloves to a heist, a hit-man dismisses a businessman's fear of murder - preferring severe beating instead - as 'total corporate mentality', an assassin says, 'Killing someone can get embarrassing. Touchy-feely. I like to kill them softly - from a distance.'<br>
<br>
Jackie Cogan's (Pitt) distance from his victims doesn't make his heart grow fonder though. Pitt plays an emotion-less killer who manages murderers and does the dirty himself, stabbing friends, shooting the guileless, turning comrades to the cops. Cogan's cynicism coats everything, even 2008's Democrat Barack Obama who, on TV, bravely rallies a Bush-ed America. 'This guy wants to tell me we're living in a community,' Cogan hisses to his corporate client (Jenkins). 'Don't make me laugh. We're living in America and you're on your own. America's not a country. It's just a business. Now fu****** pay me.'<br>
<br>
KTS showcases an America devastated by recession, its underbelly worst-hit as mobsters must turn on their own, their pistols controlled by penny-pinching corporates. It's a smart, sardonic view and despite some self-indulgent flailing, it captures the fear, loathing and loss of those caught against the American machine. As deadpan Jackie, Pitt oozes starry radiance, sometimes too glossy for his dark protagonist. His looking fabulous in every frame is a distraction - although, amidst people's brains being blown out, not always unwelcome. McNairy's remarkable as a boisterous bandit frightened witless, Gandolfini superb as Mickey, a fat, boozy, over-sexed hit-man, flown in 'coach' for a job he's not upto, everyone wrapped within a dreamy soundtrack that provocatively slides against the gore onscreen.<br>
<br>
<em>KTS</em>'s real star is actually its sound - rain pattering upon a Cadillac to crickets chirruping just before someone gets shot, olives bobbing in a Martini to police sirens wailing in the wind, <em>KTS</em> captures America's enormity, emptiness and excitement - often killing the listener with silence. And some dynamite lines.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>A girl gets possessed by an evil spirit. Will her father be able to get rid of the curse that plagues his child?</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> A young girl (Natasha Calis) buys an antique wooden box at a yard sale. Intrigued by the box with a Hebrew inscription on it, she opens it. An evil spirit is unleashed, putting her and her family’s life in danger. Will the family survive the demonic attack? The film is apparently based on a true story.<br>
<br>
The film title pretty much says it all. Years after <em>The Exorcist </em>(1973) was made, filmmakers still seek inspiration from the horror classic. What distinguishes <em>‘The Possession’</em> from <em>‘The Exorcist’</em> is merely the mention of demons in Judaism. Barring the Jewish angle, <em>The Possession, </em>too is about a young girl who’s been possessed by a mysterious evil spirit.<br>
<br>
The girl starts displaying bouts of violent and bizarre behaviour. Her divorced parents fail to decode her dilemma and evidences of demonic possession. The father (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), however, senses trouble eventually and wages war against the demon, seeking help of a Jewish exorcist (played by reggae-pop star Matisyahu). Will the demon let go of the girl?<br>
<br>
<em>The Possession</em> is high on suspense. It even manages to keep you engaged throughout with its haunting background score and quaint big houses. The actors do a fine job. The very young Natasha Calis is extremely convincing.<br>
<br>
The film, however, is low on originality and pace. Bornedal’s storytelling drags and gets repetitive, thus diluting moments which could have been scarier. The suspense unfolds a bit too late for it to be too creepy. Tracks like the parents being divorced and the girl vomiting bugs seem clichéd.<br>
<br>
<em>The Possession</em> is Jewish Exorcist. It’s gripping but lacks novelty.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>The human race once again faces fear of extinction. And the only hope for survival, as always, is Alice (Milla Jovovich). But how?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Her name is Alice and that is her wonderland -- a land you’d love to be a part of, specially if 3D is the way of life. Here cities do not exist for real; they are all but a part of the imagination and holographic representations called Sequences. There’s the New York sequence of bio chemicals, Tokyo sequence of artificial climate, Moscow sequence of snow-covered areas. In short, the setting (hi-tech stuff, we mean) is perfect.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>The future of this futuristic city looks unsure. Why? Blame it on the gangsters, the war lords and the drug peddlers.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>Even before you step into the theatre make sure you know what lies in store for you. Action and loads of noise. But then if you are an ardent fan of the 2000 AD comic strip titled Judge Dredd -- yes, yet another comic book hero comes alive on screen -- nothing is a wee bit confusing for you. You know the judges, the jury members, the executioners, the brokers of law etc are all but one people in this future city of America -- Cops. And if Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is who we are talking about, the word is super cop.<br>
<br>
As the uniformed judge -- who looks all smart, hi-tech and confident -- Karl makes sure justice prevails in every nook and corner of the Peach Tree. Watch out for the shielding of the Peach Tree scene. In fact, the onus of giving us all that extra dose of action lies with him... and his trainee partner, Anderson (Olivia Thirlby). Olivia, on the other hand, plays the perfect, obedient helper with an extra ability to predict the past... and sometimes the unsaid. But then the one leading to all that mess is the bad girl, Ma-Ma and her gangsters. Lena Headey with her bloody eyes and scared face is mean, aggressive and dangerous. The three leads indeed make up for an otherwise great (edge-of-the-sea kinda) plot.<br>
<br>
So as long as the bullets keep whizzing -- there are a couple of slow, dead and non-action moments-- <em>Dredd 3D </em>has things going its way. And if not anything else, it’s over to the scenes that show junkies falling off skyscrapers in super slow motion… stopping time and creating some great, stunning (and brutal too) visuals in 3D.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>From harmless 'calypso' cricketers to champions who mauled their enemy, how did the West Indies become cricket's giants?</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> <em>Fire in Babylon (FIB)</em> is a detailed sports documentary - and more. It's a vibrant, throbbing piece of world history told through the tale of test cricket played by one nation - the West Indies. FIB shows how the West Indies - where cricket, as an elderly Caribbean tells you in that glorious accent of rum and sun, is 'a daily situation' - went from being a team of harmless players facing humiliating defeats, to being lean, mean masters of the game. And it shows why this was vital. The West Indies's rise reflected the fight back against a colonial past, against a mindset of 'Babylon' which didn't treat all as equals, to win equality - and regard - from a grudging world.<br>
<br>
Like a calypso number, FIB draws you in gently, its narrative swaying from a 1960s of confusing defeats, to a deadlier 1970s when under Clive Lloyd's focusing captaincy, the West Indies became the team every cricketing nation feared. FIB uses a host of rich narrative techniques - cricketing legends speaking about those glory days, press reports, black-and-white TV footage of matches, archival political footage of apartheid South Africa - policeman shooting black protestors, letting loose Alsatian dogs on them - all shaken up with West Indian music. It portrays how the West Indies realized they needed to fight humiliation - hard. And win the respect of their former British colonisers, of devastating Australian pace bowlers, of crowds who chanted 'Go back to the trees, black bastards'. In 1975, the West Indies was battered by Australia. In 1976, after English captain Tony Greig sneered, 'We'll make them grovel', press reports screamed, 'Look Who's Grovelling Now!'<br>
<br>
FIB captures cricket's beauty. But it widens, showing how the West Indies unleashed a huge wave of black pride - vital when racism was acceptable in many parts of the world. By capturing how Viv Richards and Bob Marley connected - and how Ian Botham and Richards finally walked in smiling equality - FIB shows sports is more than a pastime. It's about the grit which pushes you to play a gentleman's game far from gently, going from what Frantz Fanon called the wretched of the earth, to its giants.<br>
<br>
Catch it.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>Two granddad turtles go all out to save their grand children from the mean birds. But while doing so they are captured by the same old enemy of birds and beasts -- Man. Time for the big escape.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The first impression: You love the sea turtles, the lobsters, the baby turtles, the clown fish, the sharks, the octopus.... They are cute, charming, adorable and of course, colourful. Don't miss out the sea bed and the artificial aquarium placed under water.<br>
<br>
Move on to the music: It's peppy, foot tapping and bound to keep you asking for more. Over to the plot (and all that purpose behind the storyline): A little bit disappointing. It's not that we do not buy the concept of turtles captured in underwater aquariums teaming up with all varieties of fish, lobsters, penguins, eels, Big D (the sea horse and leader of the gang), etc to make a great plan to escape. We even believe in the concept 'never say never'. But then one just can't overlook the timing: We have been seeing and listening to all that a bit too much of late.<br>
<br>
Case in point: The cute ugly fish posing as dead while he is not, simply to be thrown into the sea mistakenly (just like in the recently released 3D version of <em>Finding Nemo</em>). Next, the angry animals versus man in <em>Sammy 2 </em>lives by the 'never give up', 'nothing is impossible' and 'where there is a will there is a way' funda. Haven't we just heard that in the recently released <em>Madagascar 3</em> and <em>Ice Age 4</em> as well?<br>
<br>
Now if you can keep all that man versus animal fight aside and enjoy the great plan the sea creatures have in order to execute the greater escape, you might as well give <em>Sammy 2</em> a shot.<br>
<br>
Kids, of course, just go for it!

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>Pre teens, Sam and Suzy, run away from home, fall in love and decide to eventually settle down in marriage. Back home it's time for some crazy search missions and rescue operations.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>The year is 1965. The place is the island of New Penzance where paved roads do not exist. And the lovers in question are two adolescents, still immature, still growing up. And that is what makes Anderson’s Moonrise Kingdom different.<br>
<br>
Though in the earlier years of teen-dom, Sam and Suzy do everything that perhaps a grown up, madly in love, duo would. They talk of sweet nothings. They dream of settling down in no man's land. They read poetry and tales to one another. And bringing life to all this drama -- not for a single moment does all that teen-turned-adult philosophies and ideologies look comic -- are the performance by the leads, Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward. The two bring out the stupidity of teen life ... and the over carefulness of adulthood with ease. In fact, the two make adolescence, growing up and first love seem like cakewalk.<br>
<br>
Now, for the fun part. It's out and out situational. Because back home, searching for the two eloped lovers, are a whole lot of people -- Suzy's family, Sam's foster parents (who incidentally are not interested in his whereabouts), the neighbours, the social workers (who think the two need electric shocks to overcome absurdity in behaviour), the Khaki scouts of North America lead by scoutmaster Master Ward (Edward Norton), and of course, the well under-played, island cop, Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis).<br>
<br>
Just make sure you follow Wes Anderson pretty well to get the idea bang on.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:<em> </em></strong><em>Elsa, a french journalist, is kidnapped by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Enter the special forces....</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>If it’s the special forces we are talking about, guns and grenades, state-of-the-art technology and out-of-the-box strategies is what we are primarily on the lookout for. Sadly, here our men in uniforms are seen falling, faltering and giving up as well. No wonder, the special force comprising six super officers on a mission to get kidnapped Elsa safely back to her land end up being killed. Not to say they never try at all. At least the first half sees our men in action. For the rest, over to the story….<br>
<br>
Action and the struggle-to-survive (all seen before stuff) aside, there are moments in the movie that do deserve a special mention: the performances by every single cast that holds your attention till the very end; the state of the nation, the diplomatic statement and reactions, the panic in news agencies when a (war) correspondent is abducted; the camerawork that captures the tribal areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan in its extreme form beautifully; the not-so-happening practices being followed in some not-so-fortunate parts of the world -- women being sold to the Talibans; a Muslim woman throwing off her veil just to smile (her idea of who-gives-a-damn) before her public execution; children as young as seven forcibly taken away by the Taliban so that they can return to do the same.<br>
<br>
Agreed this was never meant to be a Daniel Pearl and Johanne Sutton real life drama come alive on screen, but what really makes Special Forces a little different is the very opening line of the movie that gives us ample food for thought -- The only way to change the world is to change the story.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>Robert Miller, a corporate honcho, is desperate to sell his trading empire. But before that a whole lot of issues – personal and corporate -- need to be tackled first.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>The setting is the big, biz world of corporate America. Hence, the plot revolves around Green bills, manipulative tycoons, profits and merges. Add to that Robert Miller (Richard Gere), caught in a trap, courtesy his mistress... and all things ‘green’ just not working in favour of him, and Arbitrage (like many movies before) puts you face-to-face with what goes on in the world where all that matters is profit and loss.<br>
<br>
As for what lies in store for the movie buff, it's definitely the performance. Not that of Susan Sarandon. Sadly, we hardly get to see her -- for most of the time she is cornered as the high society wife who might find the ongoing in her husband’s life complicated. Of course, the little that we see of her simply reiterates her position in the list of ace Hollywood actors. Next is Detective Michael Bryer (Tim Roth), who does manage to pull off a decent act. Again, he too loses the grip due to loopholes in the plot. Finally, the onus lies on Richard Gere.<br>
<br>
Needless to say he is the winner... out and out. As the father who just can't tell his daughter about the missing funds in the ‘unbalanced’ balance sheet... As the tycoon who cannot be picked up the law due to his super rich status... As the man who does not want his people to be hurt even as he indulges in financial irregularities and infidelity on the sly… As the man who wants to be richest guy in the cemetery… And as the man whose world revolves around five things only – money, money, money, money and money, Richard Gere is THE reason you might want to watch this one.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>Spotty has two missions to accomplish: A whole new world to explore and a big, bad guy to avenge. Just one problem: He is just about a year old… and growing!</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>First, what works for <em>Tarbosaurus 3D:</em> Dinosaurs, dinosaurs and more dinosaurs. After all we are talking about the tarbosaurus that lived some 80 million years ago.<br>
<br>
So what follows scene after scene is one dinosaur fighting the other... many dinosaurs hunting down a helpless prey. Surely an attention grabber… in 3D! Next is the desert landscape, all high and dry, captured pretty well… again in 3D.<br>
<br>
In fact, the parched landscape has all dinosaurs (and perhaps the viewers alike) wanting to shift to green paradise ASAP. But then struggle for survival has never really been that easy, at least for our little hero, Spotty, (named after all those cute li’l spots on his face). But before that he sees his folks die before his eyes...as he is left alone to deal with the bullies of the jungle.<br>
<br>
Enough for the EQ (emotional quotient). Not to miss out are the cute moments when Spotty is seen discovering a whole new world: quick sand for him is like the invisible giant; mammals giving birth rather than laying eggs like his species is wonder-stuff for him; falling for the blue-eyed Tarbosaurus is the best thing that could ever happen to him.<br>
<br>
Now for what plays spoilsport: Undoubtedly it’s the introduction of the varied creatures (their traits, their breeding habits, their food preferences, hunting styles) that once existed on planet Earth -- Velociraptors, Tylosaurus, Tyrannosaurus, Grenausarus, Ankylosaurus. Sometimes these even pop up in the middle of scenes that matter.<br>

But then all loopholes are taken care of when Spotty puts on a brave front to battle the big, bad Torosausrus -- One Eye. That’s when the message is loud and clear: Never give up.

<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Mamma Mia! Amanda Seyfried does not skip being on screen even for a single second. Right from the first shot till the last one, you see Amanda running from pillar to post... from cop to neighbour... from strangers to best buddies in order to find her missing sister. Now that's where <em>Gone </em>scores brownie points.<br>
<br>
Amanda is convincing as a patient who is yet to get over a traumatic past. She looks aptly helpless as the single girl who drives through the jungles of the cold Portland just to get her sister back. Then she is seen as the do-or-die sister (and victim on the lookout for justice as well) who is all out to take things evil in her stride. No wonder when she finally gives it back to the bad guy, you end up feeling relieved.<br>
<br>
Yes, more than the whodunnit and howdunnit, what makes Gone watchable is the very climax when all scores are settled with the bad guy. Precisely the moment when you feel some tension building up. However, all seems lost to the otherwise weak plot.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of the characters – including the bad guy -- you don't even realise they are even there. Blame it on the script. Or is it due to Amanda calling the shots in every shot? Take your pick...

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>When Rome is the place we’re talking about, tales are bound to be plenty, both of those living there, as well as those travelling out there.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>Now here is a movie from none other than the maker of the all-time favourite Midnight in Paris, Woody Allen. He not only directs To Rome with Love; he also happens to be the man behind the script (Woody Allen is the writer too)... and he also stars in this movie. And disappoint he does not at least when it comes to his performance. In fact, To Rome with Love scores purely for the huge star cast, and then for the performances put forth by the same cast.<br>
<br>
The four sub-plots involve 1) a young small-town Italian couple who arrive in Rome right after their marriage. The duo manages to give you an ample dose of adult humour. Special mention: Penelope Cruz who not only looks her glam self, but has the whole of Rome wanting more of Anna (read her). 2) Then there is a retired opera director (Woody Allen) and his wife (Judy Davis) who visit Rome to meet their future son-in-law... and eventually end up talent hunting. Now this is the couple that gives you maximum food for thought… and laughter. 3) Next is a famous architect (Alec Baldwin) who travels down memory lane, literally, courtesy a young architecture student (Jesse Eisenberg) living in Rome, 4) followed by an ordinary citizen of Rome (Roberto Benigni) who one fine morning finds himself as part of the creme de la creme.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, it is the script -- too many characters, too many sub plots, too many unexplained fundas/stories -- that leaves you rather disappointed. That’s when you realise To Rome with Love is no Woody Allen’s Oscar-winning (Midnight in Paris, Manhattan or Hannah and her sisters) effort... an effort wherein he managed to transform NYC and Paris into fairy land… where dreams came true.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>It’s LA calling... for love birds Annie Bean and Yul Perrkins. In other words, time to hit the road... and run!</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> They -- Annie Bean (Kristen Bell) and Yul Perrkins (Dax Shepard) -- hit the road to LA to take up a job out there is pretty clear. But why all that run? That's because their road trip gets really complicated (and pretty funny) when they are chased by a friend from the past, Alex Dmitri (Bradley Cooper), the ever-swearing Randy Anderson (Tom Arnold), a jealous ex-boyfriend Gil Rathbinn (Michael Rosenbaum) and the rest. But why are they chased in the first place?<br>
<br>
Yul is a self-proclaimed member of the witness protection programme who is happy to live a life of peace with the woman he loves. But when it's career calling for Annie one has to move on – something that has Yul all worked up... not so much for the shift, as much for the return-to-his-criminal-past now. But then there are a lot of bad guys who're waiting to settle scores with him.<br>
<br>
Now that's where all that comedy comes from. Add to that Tom Arnold's exceptional urge to swear, packaged with his accident-prone-to-the-core way to life. Next it's the road trip that continue to get crazier, thereby adding some comic relief to the otherwise slow pace of the movie.<br>
<br>
Don't go looking for high speed chase and state-of-the-art shoot outs. Just settle for some situational comedy amidst the backdrop of Pure Imagination from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and Let My Love Open the Door, and you’d say this one is watchable.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>Name, fame and power is what Georges Duroy wants. And he is ready to go to any extent to have ’em all...</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> And you thought Robert Cullen Pattinson was all about pouting and wooing the love of his life with his vampiristic Ps and Qs in place. Time now to meet the new Robert Pattinson, the actor, whose dark and sinister means justifies the wall against which his ladder leans.<br>
<br>
As Georges Duroy, getting the woman of repute (name, fame, power, money) to join him in bed is a child's play. And once done, he so unabashedly moves on to projects bigger... in a way that you are left wondering if this is the same guy who stands tall as the epitome of die-no-die-I-will-always-love-you. Of course, helping him to break away from that twilight-ism are the three leading ladies who have ruled the box office in their own ways: Uma Thurman's career-comes-first Madeleine, Christina Ricci's to-be-or-not-to-be Clotilde and Kristin Scott Thomas’ goody-goody Virginie.<br>
<br>
The setting is perfect: It's the end of the 19th century -- a time when Paree was full of horses and carriages, cancan dresses and aristocrats with a knack of doing everything with poise. The plot is tried and tested – an ex-war soldier of hardly any means dreams of making it big... by hook or crook. Yes, what goes under those porcelain-covered and satin-mixed stuff has always been questionable. But once again, standing tall in this world of greed, corruption, politicians, the elite... is none other than Pattinson. Watch him emote right in the end, where his anger, passion and sense of failure knows no boundaries.<br>
<br>
Just make sure you've read the classic novel by Guy de Maupassant so that the somewhat missing links in the script help you connect everything.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>North Carolina district is exactly the place all want to be in, including CEOs Glenn (John Lithgow) and Wade Motch (Dan Aykroyd). Trouble time for long-term Congressman Cam Brady?</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>The political sarcasm aside, what really works for <em>The Campaign</em> is its timing. With just a few more days left to go before the world gets to see the next (or perhaps same) president of the United States of America, all eyes are set on the incumbent President Barack Obama and his major challenger, former Massachusetts Governor, Republican Mitt Romney.<br>
<br>
The war between the candidates is enough to make headlines the world over. And the war between Congressman Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) and his rival candidate naive Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis), director of the local Tourism Center, in <em>The Campaign</em> is enough to give you ample food for thought... even as it tickles your (political and intellectual) funny bone.<br>
<br>
While Will Ferrell with his typical all-like-a-Prez accent and I-almost-said-it-foul-mouth manages to get close to modern American politics, Zach Galifianakis equally shines with his bizarre eccentricities. For the rest, it’s over to the typical political references and innuendos that have you asking for more: corruption, a laid-back attitude, false promises, approval ratings (the highs and lows), corporate bigwigs and their stake in the ruling political party, washing of dirty linen in campaigns….<br>
<br>
So far so good till you are half way into the movie and don't really care who wins. Why? First, blame it on the plot which has nothing new to offer that you have never seen, imagined or heard from the world of politics before. Second, even as the candidates get dirty with each passing day, there is a moment of truth (and all that <em>bhashan</em> stuff) that spoils all the fun: How much (of dirtiness) is too much when it comes to winning that hot seat. Unless, of course, you like your comedy to be all politically correct.

"<div class='Normal'><em><strong>Story</strong>: A weekend getaway turns into a nightmare for seven youngsters when a shark gets all dangerous and deadly...</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review</strong>: And you thought<em> Piranha 3D and Piranha 3DD</em> topped the chart of C-grade Hollywood cinema. Watch<em> Shark Night 3D</em> and you are left guessing what genre this one actually fits into: Not drama, for there is hardly anything other than shouting and screaming. Not horror, for there is nothing that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Not comedy, for all those double-meaning dialogues and ‘asset’ jokes fail to tickle the funny bone. You ignore everything and move on to the plot. Again, nothing that we have never imagined before.<br>
<br>
A group of college students get together for a moment sun, sand and sex at the Lake House in Louisiana Gulf. But even before they can actually get naughty and decide to hit the beach and the ocean, it's time for the big, bad Shark out there to get more naughty... and attack. This is followed by blood, missing limbs and god knows what. Scary? Not really. After all, what can a teeny-weeny frail-looking creature (even on 3D) do to us.<br>
<br>
Not acceptable, specially when it’s the same Hollywood that has given us jaw-dropping shark tales like <em>Jaws, Deep Blue Sea, 12 days of Terror….</em>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>It's school time for Nemo. But when he is captured and taken away to Sydney, life is no longer the same for him... or his over-protective dad.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> What’s new? Nothing. It’s the same <em>Finding Nemo </em>that you first saw in the year 2003 – no additions... and no subtractions in this 2012 version. What’s old? Nothing. Though you have seen it all before, everything looks new out there. The show stealer (that makes everything a whole new world) is none other than the 3D effect. How else do you explain the Great Barrier Reef looking rich and unexplored. <em>Finding Nemo </em>(2012) with its bright and vivacious 3D effects is worth every shot.<br>
<br>
As for the plot, here is yet another animation that teaches us – tweens, teens and adults alike – a lesson or two in friendship (something the sea creatures call ‘tankhood’) and the nothing-is-impossible <em>mantra</em> of life. But once again what takes us by surprise is the very reason this movie bagged the Best Academy Award (Animation) that year – here daddy (not mamma) is the hero, daddy knows (and does not know) best, daddy believes there is nothing son Nemo cannot do. For Nemo, it’s all about the my-daddy-strongest lesson of life.<br>
<br>
Enough to grasp (for first-timers) and re-grasp (for those who are watching it for the second time)... as you sail beyond the spectacular beauty of what lies beneath… in 3D – Clownfish, Regal Tang, Oysters, Sharks, Whales, Sea monsters, other sea creatures... and of course, Man and his evil instinct of capturing all that is beautiful.<br>
<br>
Watch <em>Finding Nemo</em> (in 3D) if you have never seen it before. Watch <em>Finding Nemo</em> once again – this time in 3D -- if you have seen it all before.

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> When Bruce Willis stars in an action film, you know what lies ahead. Right? Wrong. Sadly, this action thriller leaves you asking for much, much more of the man in question. Blame it on the script, the timing of those action cuts (basically an amalgamation of action movies like Die Hard, the Bourne series and other A-list Hollywood movies) and car chases with daredevil stunts, an evil female CIA chief... But the end of it all, Bruce is left with just 20 minutes of screen time in the initial few frames. Sad. Of course, there’s is the Man of Steel Henry Cavill taking the story forward, till you come across Sigorne Weaver as the baddie.<br>
<br>
But then making up for all that is the what-lies-in-the-suitcase tension. Will (Henry Cavill), an American trader, joins his family -- Dad (Bruce Willis) and the rest of his family... on their yacht in Spain for the annual family holiday. Post a shopping spree along the shore, Will returns to find his family gone... to be executed within 24 hours if a missing briefcase is not delivered to their kidnappers. Undoubtedly, the next thing he is seen doing is running to every nook and corner of the city to hunt down those who did it all... right from the intelligence agents to the men on the run.<br>

And while he does that, you wonder what’s in that mysterious suitcase. Now, what’s in it? Don’t go with too many expectations... and you shall not complain between all that twists and turns in this conspiracy action thriller.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>Douglas Quaid is bored of a life where everything is perfect and everyday is like any other day. Hence he is on the lookout for some fun -- perhaps a chance to live his dream for real. What better way to do that than go in for a recall session. Time for dreams to come true? Or dreams to be shattered?</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> And you thought it’s time to recall... rewind... reboot... the 1990 movie by the same name. Well, the plot is almost same, but rest assured, <em>Total Recall 2012</em> is understandably more hi-tech, racy and edge-of-the-seat kind of sci-fi thriller.<br>
<br>
But first, time for a little self-recall: Enter Circa 1990. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Douglas Quail has a dream to live on Mars. Getting him back to reality each time is his wife Lori, till realities clash with memories at the Rekall centre. What follows next is a war on Mars... for Mars... by the Martians. Of course, the one standing tall is none other than Arnold himself as the man who is all out to get his facts in place. That’s about all. Now this is exactly where the re-packaged <em>Total Recall</em> breaks away from its predecessor. Colin Farrell's Quaid is more quick with the kicks, good with the gadgets, great with the guns... and good with the babes. And when he is all confused, courtesy the reality versus fiction war, he looks it. Of course, he is smart to live in the moment: For him, it is not about who he was, but who he is. In this case, fighting for the right cause.<br>
<br>
But the real surprise package in here is none other than Kate Beckinsale. Her punches do manage to give all action buffs the ample kick. As for all you playstation freaks, ample jaw dropping stuff out there – flying cars getting bashed up, helicopter chase aplenty, laser guns with special abilities to grip the victim, palm phones (literally), state-of-the-art monorails and lifts, super-tech buildings, gravity reversal moments, terrorist attacks and a clash of the United Federation of Britain with the Colony. Finally, for the literary buffs: What would have <em>Total Recall</em> (both the 1990 and 2012 version) been without Philip K Dick’s short story titled: <em>We can Remember It For You Wholesale.</em><br>
<br>
So have no illusions… for <em>Total Recall</em> (2012) has no Martian landscape… no Martian tales… no Martians themselves, yet ample to go in for a total recall -- a new memory implant, we mean!

<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>When it's the Step Up series you're talking about, you know what the deal is all about. It’s not about putting on the dancing shoes, but putting on the tights. And once done, nothing can stop our bunch of street dancers from turning into Miami’s most happening movers and shakers. They are ready to show their moves just about anywhere (in the middle of a bustling street; on the top of cars). They are ready to shake a leg or two to almost any music (in this case, it's the honking of cars). They are ready to do it just about anytime (what better way to kill time in a traffic jam than go the dancing way).<br>
<br>
So if dance is what you're looking for, you are not going to be disappointed. But if it's the plot, here goes: Step Up (2006) was all about street dancer Channing Tatum getting the nuances of ballet right. Step Up 2:The Streets (2008) was all about yet another ballet dancer getting the moves right on street. As for Step Up 3D (2010), it was all about the war of street dancers. Talk of the 2012 version and it’s dancing done for a cause. Of course, making up for all that lack of a great plot is the music, some great chemistry between the lead pairs -- Ryan Guzman and Kathryn McCormick, winner of the So You Think You Can Dance series -- and of course, the cutting-edge flash mobs.<br>
<br>
So you think you can (handle all that) dance? Then go for it....

Louis (Josh Gad) is in love with Peaches. Diego is in love with Shira (Jennifer Lopez). You, of course, are (and will once again be) in love with the Ice Age series.<br>

The franchise carries on showcasing its brilliant art work, its warm and vibrant characters and its straight-from-the-heart story of team spirit and survival, of not only the fittest, but the weakest too. Not to miss out are the lessons for life you get to re-learn: Never leave a friend behind. But before that there are loads of goodies for all you kidos... and biggies alike.<br>
<br>
Now what really sets this sequel apart from the earlier versions is the action unlimited. There isn't a single second when the screen is not ablaze with fights, battles and survival-of-the-fittest drama. Add to that some witty one liners and a couple of memorable moments. Case in point, the tidal waves, deadly sea creatures, avalanches, crabs, water infested by pirates headed by Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage), a war battalion, leaves turned into fighter planes, sharks... and water, water everywhere. Special mention: Peaches as the rebellious teen who is just too tired of her parents controlling her life and the blue whale who steals the show, literally. And in case you wondering whatever happened to Scratte, here goes: Scratte, as always, manages to create utter mayhem on screen... and add that extra dose of laughter.<br>
<br>
Yes, Ice Age 4 is a fitting sequel to the animal saga that turned out to be a moving human parable when it was first released in 2002. Excellent in 3-D and eminently watchable in 2-D too, Ice Age 4 is indeed alluring fare for the family this weekend.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>As a child, Abe (Abraham Lincoln) witnessed the most disturbing event of his life – the death of his mother after she has bitten by a vampire – that changed him (and his life) forever. Abe then took it on him to play hunter and end the walking dead citizenry. But then, this war with vampires was all about a tyrannical movement called slavery.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>Abraham Lincoln would have surely had a good laugh after seeing this one. You, on the other hand, will surely have fun while watching the movie. And that’s because this wicked period tale keeps your mind busy all throughout -- you find it really hard to distinguish fact from fiction. Of course, those of you who have actually read Seth Grahame-Smith’s fiction novel by the same name have all your facts in place. So much so, expectations (of those into the literally side) are a bit high. Does Abraham: Lincoln Vampire Hunter, the movie, deliver?<br>
<br>
The setting works brilliantly. It’s dark, sepia and old European charm. Add to that loads of fireworks, blood-stained teeth of vampires, bats aplenty, music in sync with the huffing-pufffing steam engine, gothic architecture... and visually you have nothing much to complain. Special mention: The 'dinner is served' scene. And if you are patient enough till the end, the action (and speed) is unlimited. Sadly, the first half is rather slow. Even the action cuts find place only when the vampires are spotted on screen. But when the fangs do what hands cannot, the energy is feverish... breathless... gruesome.<br>
<br>
Now, that is not to say there is nothing in the earlier part of the movie that gives you your money's worth. Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) as the woman who is always on the lookout for out-of-the-box adventure steals the show when she uses Lincoln's hat as a stool... simply to rise to his level (in every sense of the word) and kiss him. Later, Mary Winstead is more convincing as the mother who has lost her little son... and as the wife who chooses to be the woman behind the successful man. Next is Dominic Cooper’s Henry who, as the suave, calm and if-need-be-deadly vampire, completely overshadows Benjamin Walker’s Abraham Lincoln. But then it’s only when the carefree and confused Benjamin turns into President does he fit the role to the tee. He is commanding, towering and above all, human. Don't miss out the makeover too – gangly with tired eyes.<br>
<br>
Finally, it’s writer Seth Grahame-Smith for kicking all that Vampire butt... and director Timur Bekmambetov who makes sure to add his bit to this entertaining and engrossing slice of historical revisionism. Watch what he does with all that American silver. Wish, apart from Lincoln’s fight with the axe, he had done a little bit more with the depiction of all that Lincoln-ic speeches and anti-slavery slogans, movements and its very end.<br>
<br>
So who is the real hero in here? None other than Abe... Abraham Lincoln... the former president of the United States... for living a life that hardly needed vampires to make it incredible!<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>The rich Philippe’s life changes post a paragliding experience gone wrong. He takes to the wheel cheer for life. So what he wants next is a caretaker. Enter Driss, who not just takes good care of Philippe, but also takes his friendship with Philippe to a whole new level.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>Now how many of us out there can make the best of the very little (literally) that we have? How many of us can laugh at our own shortcomings – both physical and emotional? Guess not many. After all, no one is born a hero; you become heroic only when you decide to be one. Celebrating this spirit of never-say-never is The Intouchables – a story of the white aristocrat, Philippe (Francois Cluzet) who hires the black Driss (Omar Sy) only later to realise life is all about living in the moment... a true story based on the memoir named You Changed My life by Abdel Sellou.<br>
<br>
For the record, The Intouchables became the second most successful French film of all time, breaking all box office records outside the English circuit. And it’s not just the plot that helped the movie do this. It’s also the perfect blend of the drama (all serious and emotional stuff bringing out the helplessness of a then-adventure-freak-now-<wbr></wbr>differently-abled man) and comedy (smart dialogues coupled with funny moments... at time irreverent) that works big time. There are even some Obama-Bush-Kennedy jokes in there.<br>
<br>
Next are the performances. While Francois Cluzet as Philippe brilliantly metamorphoses into the what-the-heck-I-can-do-it persona from the no-woman-will-love-me-ever, Omar Sy's Driss gives you that extra dose of humour – situational, through expressions and dialogues. So much so you can’t think of anyone more deserving for the César Award for Best Actor this actor lays claims to. Sample this: His references at a job interview are Kool Gang, earth, wind and fire. He has a problem with fixed timings at work and loves to doze off when on duty. He finds all that classy jazz music ‘Tom and Jerry’ stuff. In fact, the real winner here, in the movie, is actually Driss. Not because he does not throw in the towel after a week – understandably Philippe is a difficult man to please. Or for that matter, not even because he tips Philippe on the erogenous zone.<br>
<br>
While he is making Philippe like his own self– all happy and lively, he is seen adapting to all that aristocratic way of life. He no longer thinks red splash on white is a piece of trash one should never buy; he no longer wants money for every little gesture he does. But before that here is Driss... who finds molten cake all squashy and raw.... who mistakes foot cream as hair shampoo wondering where all that lather is....<br>
<br>
A feel-good dramedy... against the sparkling Paris by night. A feel-good real life story of two buddies who still continue to live happily ever after even today.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Detective Dylan Dog is happy snooping on cheating husbands. Of course, there’s a famous past he lays claim to. What? Dylan excelled in paranormal cases. He was the link between the real and the living dead. Little does he know it's now time to get back to what he does best -- fighting the bloody creatures....<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> If fear factor is what you’re looking for (since the filmmakers classify this as horror), there are the typical elements to choose from – blood dripping from the ceiling, someone appearing from nowhere on the other side of the window pane, scary masks of sharp-toothed monsters. We, however, are a little brave... so we don’t really get all that scared. If laughter is what you’re looking for (since the filmmakers classify this as comedy too), there are a couple of moments... and one-liners in there. Again, there is nothing that seems enough to really, really tickle our funny bones.<br>
<br>
So does that mean Dylan Dog: The Dead of Night is just not watchable? It is watchable, for the movie is based on Tiziano Sclavi's Italian comic book series by the same name. So thrill, action, speed, chase, mystery and supernatural are there in aplenty.<br>
<br>
Of course, the one standing out in this bloody war on the streets is Brandon Routh. As detective Dylan Dog, dressed in the signature red shirt, he is convincing, cool, calm and suave. Watch him in the final sequence where he guns down the werewolves Bond style. Next is Sam Huntington’s Marcus who gives us the much-needed relief in this hit-and-run werewolf versus human battle. It’s only when he turns into the living dead... feasting on zombie buffet and getting a job done at the body shop does the fun begin.<br>
<br>
Till then, it’s over to werewolves, vampires and zombies who are struggling to be the master in this (somewhat cliché) war of the good monsters versus the bad ones.

<strong>Movie Review: </strong> what’s so brave about Brave? The very Princess in question, Merida (Kelly Macdonald), who does not believe in playing by the rules come what may. So much so, she wants a bow and arrow on her birthday unlike the princess next door. In fact, she surely is in for a big fan following amongst rebellious teens this weekend. Why? She hates perfection. She hates rules and regulations. And she hates being told what to do and not to do. For her, life is all about being free to choose... free to express... free to fly... even if that means there’s danger ahead. The idea is pretty clear (read brave) in this animation movie -- As long as you make your own choice, you are ready to take things in your stride... and come out winner eventually. Case in point, keep praying for your nagging parents to change, but just be ready to set things right if that change is not for good, but far, far worse.<br>
<br>
The animation is bright, colourful and magical. Adding to that is the scenic beauty, soothing music and a couple of sweet melodies. Sprinkle that with the usual magical spells, legendary tales of years gone by and humourous moments to get your dose of weekend entertainment. As for those on the lookout for something emotional, there’s the do-not-miss bonding between the King, Queen and their daughter.<br>
<br>
But then it’s once again the very girl power that takes you by surprise, specially when Princess Merida decides to change the rules of the games in this movie that presents Hollywood’s version of our very own swayamvar. Woman(iya) power indeed!<br>

Just like it is for Ash (Falk Hentschel) who forms a dance troupe from scratch... from nothing at all. Now, that is when we know StreetDance 2 is going to be pretty different from it’s prequel. Get ready for a trip round the world -- London, Paris, New York, Amsterdam -- as the dance master is all out to select the best of them all. And once the team is in place, you shall have no reason to complain, specially if you are into (street) dancing. The finale at the European Dance Competition is worth the effort.<br>
<br>
Now, for the storyline. There is nothing much to boast about, but then movies like these were never meant to be high on the intellectual quotient; it needs to give you the high as far as the moves go. And that it does. There is break dance, freeze, hip hop. There is also popping, locking, slouching.<br>
<br>
But then more than the moves, it’s the multi-talented, multi-cultural and multi-indigenous troupe that needs to be applauded here. Not to miss out is the fusion: StreetDance (2010) was all about the Street dance-Ballet combo; StreetDance (2012) is about the Street dance-Latino effect. Special mention: The thumping music.<br>
<br>
So, here’s calling all you movers and shakers out there, if dance is your food of life, step on.

Once again the teeth-gnashing critters give us the usual blood fest that's meant only for those who have an insatiable appetite for gore. Like the prequel, Piranha 3DD makes sure there is blood splattered across the screen while all are reduced to skeletons.<br>
<br>
The only difference this time is the location: It’s no longer Lake Victoria, but Cross Lake under attack of the Piranhas who navigate their way through other underwater lakes. And once there, the Big Wet Fest becomes a dumping ground of all kinds of body parts. Of course, keeping you on the edge of the seats are the very Piranhas and their sudden attack from nowhere.<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Tom Cruise as rock star of the 80s? Mission Accomplished! How else do you explain Ethan Hunt in total control... this time cruising along with his long mane, outlandish outfit and head banging moves. Tom Cruise fans, your hero has perhaps never looked (and been) so eccentric, dirty, sweaty, and of course, wild.<br>
<br>
Not to say, the others lag behind. There is Alec Baldwin and his business partner Lonny (Russell Brand) who leave no stone unturned when it comes to giving you that extra dose of laughter... with an extra dose of surprise! Funny. Next, there is the politically motivated protest, led by Patricia Whitmore (Catherine Zeta-Jones) being held outside the Bourbon bar in order to ‘clean society of rock and roll’ stuff. Ironically, Zeta is seen salivating the most when it comes to getting a hand or two literally on the rock star. Funny. Finally, it’s Julianna and Diego who take us through romance of the 80s... when love was all about sweet nothings... against the background of the iconic Hollywood logo.<br>
<br>
As for the storyline, Rock of Ages is based on the famous Broadway Musical and is set in 1987. So you should know what to expect. Don’t go looking for a great plot and something you have never seen before. Of course, making up for that is the setting of the then LA, generously peppered with Rock’s greatest anthems... featuring the music by Poison, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, Guns N’ Roses, Journey, Foreigner... and many more....<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> When in Rome do as the Romans? Not really. Sometimes it’s best to let your hair down and do as the ‘Americanos’ do. Precisely what we see the King of New York, Alex (Ben Stiller), do as he returns with his buddies Marty, the smart-ass zebra (Chris Rock), Melman, the completely in love giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria, the equally in love hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), after having charmed us with their escapades in their earlier two adventures. Their third outing, this time in Europe, is equally charming, with eye-popping visuals, vibrant animation, rib-tickling teasers, nuclear reactors, never ending chases, and a joyous abandon that makes for perfect tween (teen and adults alike) fare. As for the plot, the foursome are seen doing what they do best – struggling to reach America, via Europe. Now, that’s where the fun begins, sometimes at the Roman Colosseum, sometimes at the Vatican, sometimes at the casino, and sometimes at the always-on-the-move circus.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Nothing could be a more happening vacation for five happy-go-lucky youngsters than taking off to the woods. But then the woods have never really been that safe.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The Cabin in the Woods is more about the ‘why factor’ than the ‘how factor’: Why do the lambs (a group of bubbly teens) cross the gates and reach the killing ground (a haunted cabin in the middle of nowhere) in almost every horror movie? Why do the lambs choose to part ways to combat the evil dead in almost every horror movie? Or for that matter, why do those who usually coochy coo in almost every horror movie choose to do it in the most deadliest of spots? Well, that’s how it’s meant to be in the scary world. Period. But before that, here’s the not-so-good news for horror buffs: Except for a very few genuine scares - heads being separated from bodies, a woman whispering in the dead of night, blood and gore everywhere -- The Cabin in the Woods has nothing much in store when it comes to giving you the real jeebies. But then the movie has loads of the guessing games that could leave the same horror fan pretty satisfied. After all, horror works till victims make their free (and often wrong) choice... till they keep on suffering... till the cliches are in place.<br>
<br>
Cliche 1: Five teens want to get a little wild in the woods during their vacation time. They are the typical horror victims -- Curt (Chris Hemsworth) who thinks he is all cool and hot, Miss Perfect Dana (Kristen Connolly); Jules (Anna Hutchison) for whom looking blond is the in-thing, the ever-swearing funny guy, Marty (Fran Kranz) and Mr Sober Guy Holden (Jesse Williams).<br>
<br>
Cliche 2: The destination they choose is a place that does not show up on the GPS, where traffic cameras do not exist, where the last fuel station does not accept credit cards. Cliche 3: What follows next is perhaps easy to guess: a two-way mirror, a painting of blood sucking creatures , a cellar perfect to play truth or dare, a basement full of strange and weird items, and finally a disturbing journal of Anna Buckner, which when read has the dead rising from their graves.<br>
<br>
So far so good. But then as the gruesome killing of teens continue, what keeps you on the edge is the question the movie actually began with: the why factor. Why can’t horror movies live without its cliches? Is it about controlling the outcome? Or is it about ritual sacrifices - that of the ancient gods, that of fate, and that of new age viewers (the betting game and reality shows)?<br>
<br>
For answers, get to the basement of the cabin in that dark wood for there’s something diabolic cooking down there.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>What binds three friends together is their urge to kill their respective bosses....<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Bosses! Good bosses. Great bosses. Inspiring bosses. Chilled out bosses. Buddy bosses.... Mean bosses. Selfish bosses. Humiliating bosses. Manipulative bosses. Sexually starved bosses.... The world is full of different kinds of bosses. If you are lucky enough, work can be cakewalk; workplace can be fun. But if your leader is a horrible boss, just as the unlucky three in Horrible Bosses, the five-years-down-the-line planning is pretty obvious - getting rid of that boss. But how?<br>
<br>
That is just the point where this movie scores considering we have had our ultimate good-employee-terror-of-a-boss ordeal in The Devil Wears Prada. Here, more than the evilness of the boss (it is there in aplenty), it’s the how-to-get-rid of the boss ideas that makes every moment a funny one. Not just brought out through (rather adult) one-liners, but also through the various incidents. Add to that some oh-I-can-relate-to-that-stereotypical character, good performances, crazy situations... and you are sure to laugh your way to theatres.<br>
<br>
Sample this: Nick Hendricks (Jason Bateman) takes pride in being the ‘Yes Man’ at work, even if it means a forceful gulping down of his boss’s eighteen-year-old scotch at eight in the morning. His boss, Dave Harken (Kevin Spacey), simply trusts his own self when it comes to taking on that extra portfolio... for 85 per cent of the total salary. Next is the cool Kurt Buckman (Jason Sudeikis) coping with Thomas (Steve Wiebe). He can’t understand why his new boss can’t stick to old ways. The new way means turning workplace into one full of heroin and heroine. Finally, it’s Jennifer Aniston as Julia Harris, the dentist, who ‘does not mind an extra drill or two’ as long as the one doing it is Dale Arbus (Charlie Day).<br>
<br>
So do the three poor souls really get to win over... and kill their respective bosses? Well, can’t really say that here though we do get to learn the secret mantra to success at work: Be your own boss. Now, they don’t teach that at B-schools! Do they?

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> The evil Queen longs for a life without death. But the only way she can have it is being destroying the fairest of them all -- Snow White. She needs to rip off Snow White’s heart from within her body, literally. But the only place where she can reach Snow White is the forest – just where her evil powers do not work. Can the Huntsman, chosen by her, do the needful?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Is it right to tamper with tales we have actually grown up on? Yes. It’s okay to experiment with fairy tales as long as it’s gripping, racy and, if need be, deadly. And the level of experimenting could range from anything between twists and turns in the storyline to making the evil Queen look much more conniving... much more dangerous... much more larger than life. Believe it or not, the evil Ravenna here overshadows Snow White in every sense of the word. Talk of the character and Queen Ravenna comes across as the epitome of the woman who wants everything – money, fame, kingdom, beauty forever and immortality – at the cost of anything. Talk of the actor and Charlize Theron leaves no stone unturned when it comes to executing that power, passion and utmost greed. She is sometimes seen doing what she ought to do with watery, fiery eyes, sometimes with powerful speeches and monologues... and sometimes with the help of special effects.<br>
<br>
The very first shot and you know Snow White and the Huntsman is going to be a jolly good visual treat, often brought out through contrasts. There are three stunningly red drops of blood in the white, snow covered landscape right in the beginning; the end has the same three drops of blood against the backdrop of the stony castle. And in between lies the chase through the forbidding Dark Forest full of black shadows, ugly creatures, hissing snakes, followed by the seven dwarfs and their magical Fairy Land full of colourful butterflies, sparkling streams and birds singing here and there. In fact, there are times you are left wondering how this would look in 3D, specially when the chase and battles get more gloomy with horses, the Black Army, swords and shields.<br>
<br>
Finally, it is the sharp contrast to Julia Roberts’ recently released Mirror Mirror that works in favour of this one. If that was funny, crazy and not-so-serious, this one is dark and vicious. However, it’s the length of the movie that seems a way too long. But then all is justified when first time director, Rupert Sanders, gets back to the tried and tested fairly tale formula (of the happily-ever-after kiss) right in time. And all logic be damned... for there are two men – The Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) and Prince William (Sam Claflin) -- trying to woo the Princess. Wonder who gets to kiss Ms. White?<br>
<br>
For now, over to Snow White, her (fairy) tale, the thumping background score, the visual treat, the fact that you know it (the story, we mean) all... and of course, Queen Ravenna.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> It's a matter of survival for a group of oil workers in Alaska caught in the middle of nowhere. It's a matter of time, they feel, before they can get home. Really?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Liam Neeson is the angry man here who calls the shots when it comes to a group of eight survivors (a freaky storm crashes their airplane), now caught in the snow covered mountains of Alaska. He hates it when the survivors rob their (now dead) fellow passengers of their wallets and watches. He thinks it is insane and inhuman to leave the dead unburied in the snow; the least they ought to do is say a little prayer for the dead. In short, he wants humanity and sanity to stay intact even as the team faces a crisis... even if that means losing his cool now and then. But then there is someone out there who is angrier than Liam. Who? It's a pack of big, bad, wolves that salivate each time they spot outsiders within their territory. Now this is what makes The Grey worth a watch. We've heard of stories of survival; it's now time for survival of the fittest -- animal instinct versus that of man's physical capabilities.<br>
<br>
Interestingly, what keeps you glued to your seats (despite the slow pace of the movie) is the sudden appearance and attack of wolves from nowhere. Moreover, you actually keep wondering who shall be the next (victim) out of the eight to fall prey to the deadly animal. Yes, with every passing moment, the survivors are left to a bare handful. But nothing can take away from man the one thing that makes him different and superior to beasts – self confidence. Between each attacks you have the group sharing anecdotes... remembering dear ones... and bonding the guy way. You even see them fail to decipher what is most needed at that hour to survive – food, sleep or reaching the far-off forest so that they can be far away from the wolves.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, it's Liam Neeson's Ottway as the fear fighter who stands tall in this group of eight, specially when he looks the wolf right in the eye... in the final shot. Not to say the others do not put forth the craziness, restlessness and fear as is the need of the hour (and script).<br>
<br>
But then, the real winner – surprisingly – here are the pack of wolves. Their wails, their howls, their barks, their whimper, their sparkling eyes (the only part visible in the dead, cold night), and their ultimate ferocious attacks are enough to give you the chills.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Agent J has to stop the alien criminal from assassinating his partner, Agent K... in time. But how?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Let’s rewind history. Shall we! It’s been a decade since the Men in Black (MIB) put on their suits for the last time ever: first in 1997 and then in 2002. So it won’t really be a bad idea to brush up a little on why we liked (and missed) the secret society of protectors. Well, the MIB gave us good comedy, great special effects, inspiring performances, and ample action. Welcome to Circa 2012 and nothing much seems to have changed.<br>
<br>
There’s Agent J (Will Smith) who still gives us rib-tickling moments with his one liners. In his own words: ‘Men for me are ‘K’; women for me are ‘O’. I refer to couples as ‘OK’!’ There’s the grumpy, agent-of-hardly-any-words, K (Tommy Lee Jones), and tales of his heroic deeds and achievements that have been saving planet Earth. And above all, there are aliens, once again seen as our next-door friendly refugees who are still using New York as their hideout from mean intergalactic creatures. Of course, now we have Boris the animal (Jemaine Clement), who has just escaped from the Lunar prison and is on the lookout for Agent K for settling scores of the last forty years. Agent J, on the other hand, is on a spree to change the course of his buddy and partner’s life... and that of mankind. All this, simply to save the future while he travels back in time.<br>
<br>
Once the time travel begins (in the movie), it is simply a trip down memory lane. You are actually transported to the USA of the 1960s... in time to witness the launch of Apollo 11 and man’s maiden journey to the moon. Don’t miss out the setting, the headline makers and the style statement of the Big Brother then. And just incase you thought the Smith-Jones pairing is what kept the MIB series alive, here is more. No doubt, the two have put up a great show in all MIB movies, but taking the partnership forward this time is the Will Smith (Agent J) - Josh Brolin (Agent K, the younger one) bonding. In fact, it’s hard to believe that Agent K of the 1960s is not really Agent K of 2012. So convincing is Brolin as the young Tommy Lee Jones. As for Will Smith, he fits the bill (the MIB suit in every sense of the word) as always.<br>
<br>
Now, for the special effects. The monster show where Smith fights it out with a huge fish that attacks diners is surely worth every penny. The moment when Smith jumps off the Empire State Building to travel back to the past is worth every cutting-edge moment. Add to that some cool gadgets -- the state-of-the-art MIB workplace and the wheel Hoover-bike, for instance -- and you are left high and dry.<br>
<br>
Sadly, it’s the 3D that does not really spruce up the drama, but once you know you are in for some real MIB-isms (a hi-tech, buddy sci-fi comedy that features everything weird, creepy, funny and wonderful in and around the universe), you don’t really care.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> It does not take long for Edgar Allen Poe’s murder mystery tales to turn into reality, courtesy a serial killer. Now, what will it take to stop those gruesome murders?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Those into Edgar Allen Poe shall be left satisfied. The first shot of the movie tells you this one is possibly on the lines of a biography: There have been lots of theories as to how Poe died; The Raven adds a new dimension. Those into his tales of mystery too shall have no reason to complain. The Raven is an amalgamation of a couple of whodunnit tales from the greatest inventor of the detective genre. And those into neither, can treat The Raven as your usual dose of murder, mystery and thrill.<br>
<br>
First, it’s two women who are murdered in a locked room. Enter detective Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) who traces it back to Poe’s The Murders in the Rue Morgue. Next, a man is discovered sliced into two, just as in Poe’s The Pit and the Pendulum. Enter detective Fields... this time with Edgar Allen Poe (John Cusack) himself. Interestingly, it’s Poe himself who ends up solving his own murder mysteries. But then you’ve got to pay the price. In this case, blood, gore and soul-stirring crime, specially when the pendulum cuts the man into two. As for John Cusack, he is bang on as Poe when it comes to the looks. As for Poe’s character, it comes rather naturally to the actor.<br>
<br>
Back to the murder and thrill. There are tense moments, chases, one puzzle leading to the other. There’s also a Victorian setting, a serial-killer, his tricks... and of course, Edgar Allen Poe’s macabre tales.

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> It has all the requirements of a typical horror movie. A lonely little girl in the lonely woods. The little girl playing with stuffed toys and a talking teddy bear. A beautiful house (gothic again) in the middle of nowhere. Strange whispers in the dead of night... specially when the couple want to get a little cozy. Sounds scary? Over to more.<br>
<br>
Sally has just moved into this big, haunted house where strange little things (half bat, half rat, half human... whatever it is. We are never actually told) whisper sweet nothings. Seems like they first want kids to be their buddies, and later want their teeth in return. Why? Ask the now-dead owner, Mr Blackwood, of the house. Of course, the new owners -- Sally's dad and mom -- are too busy re-designing the whole thing to impress the boss. So more than half the movie goes into convincing mom and dad that there is someone out there.<br>
<br>
For the remaining part, it’s bonding time between Kim (Katie Holmes) and Sally (Baille Madison). In fact, Katie’s struggle to be the perfect mom to Sally, and Sally’s slow but steady confiding in Katie is worth a watch.<br>

In case you still wondering where all that fear factor is, and what really works in this dark, horror movie, it's the very title: Don’t be afraid of the dark. Literally!<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Nothing is impossible for 12-year-old Ted when it comes to wooing Audrey, the girl he can't take his eyes off. Even if that means gifting her what is next to impossible in this tailor-made town.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> You don't have to be under-12 to grasp all that fun and laughter in the zaniest town of Thneedville. You don’t even have to be over-12 to get the message the movie quiet strongly sends out - plant trees to save the environment. The credit goes to American writer and cartoonist, Theodor Seuss Geisel (better known as Dr Seuss).<br>
<br>
Ted loves Audrey who for once wants to see a real, breathing, tree. Quite difficult in a land where air is sold in bottles. But when our tweeny hero catches up with Once-ler, not only is he gifted with the only remaining seed of the Trufulla tree, he (and we) are made aware of what could happen to Nature sans trees. All this and more, as the script follows Dr Seuss’ 61-pager pictorial children's book by the same name.<br>
<br>
The movie has its share of emotional moments - watch the last tree being felled; watch the lovely creatures migrating to a land where trees are not felled. However, we wish there was more. It has its share of funny moments too - rainfall of marshmallows, the dream sequence of Once-ler. Wish there was more of this too. Next is the voice over. Zac Efron's Ted comes across as the peppy happy-go-lucky youth, followed by the girl-next-door Audrey (Taylor Swift). Ed Helms’ Once-ler is a decent mix of the good-guy-turned-bad-turned-good. But then it’s Danny DeVito’s Lorax who comes across as authoritative enough to be guardian of the forest.<br>
<br>
Finally, what really takes you by surprise (considering the original was written sometime in 1971) is the 'then' and 'now' setting. Before the trees were cut, Thneedville was full of Brown Bar-ba-loots playing in the shade and the Humming fish humming all over. Now that the trees no longer exist, Thneedville is all about shopping centres, parking slots and hi-tech roads. As for the animation, except for The Lorax himself, sadly no one really seems to pop up out of the pages.<br>
<br>
We know this one is all about what it has to say... but one simply can’t overlook the how-it has-to-say factor, specially when animation is the medium.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Manhattan girl Seeta strings along three Romeos, until she discovers all there is to know about love.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong>This one is as fruity as a seetaphal gone sour. Our Seeta of yore would take the first flight to NYC after watching this fruit salad. Introducing the new age Manhattan ki Seeta Makenzie (Melanie Kannokada). Adopted and raised in Manhattan, she’s modern, hip, wears bikini-tops and has a mono-kini view of love. Enter, Rahul (Arjun Gupta), Tom (Michael Derek) and Bhavuk (Lavrenti Lopes), three friends who quite randomly fall head-over-heels in love with Seeta, and pull the most clichéd tricks out of their ‘Dating for Dummies’ manual. Of course, they get a 1-on-1 crash course from their wing women Ramya (Leah Kavita) and Caroline (Carolyn Korale), who only end up adding unwanted dimensions to this love ‘rectangle’.<br>
<br>
This romance turns out to be more like a ‘Bachelorette’-ish American dating game show, what with Seeta fashionably three-timing her suitors (fidelity and reason be damned). The desperados shamelessly sign on for this open affair too. All this while Seeta is still blissfully single and believes that love is a lie which teenagers tell themselves, while having sex for the first time. Baah! Not that she jumps into bed with any one of the boys (remember she’s Seeta after all); instead, they’re all left wide-eyed ‘hanging in’ there. For relief, we were hoping she would break into a song sequence on the pretty Hudson River, but no, this epic love story (pun intended) is as clueless as a foreigner finding his way around Manhattan’s 100-odd streets. There’s very little love, lies or sex in the city. By the end, you wouldn’t care if you’re watching Seeta, Geeta or Parineeta.<br>
<br>
Former Miss India-USA, Melanie Kannokada, is fairly attractive, but doesn’t have the oomph or the aura to essay this role. Seeta’s suitors are as blah as this unoriginal love story.<br>
<br>
Director of this Indie-film, Chandra Pemmaraju, set out to make a love story against the backdrop of an electrifying NYC, but ended up with a film which reminds you of a bad episode of an American sitcom. For those mad about Manhattan, the only thing that stands out here is a lively shot of the Grand Central station.<br>
<br>
For the rest, skip Love, Lies...and go for a siesta instead.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> A couple of British retirees have their own share of problems to deal with. It’s only after they reach a not-so-happening hotel in India that life turns into a roller coaster ride...<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Life begins at 60... at least for a group of seven ‘old and beautiful’ lot in this British film. Of course, there’s a pretty tough ride they’ve got to first undertake.<br>
<br>
1) Evelyn Greenslade (Judi Dench) is stuck with her broadband connection since it’s in her late husband’s name. 2) Muriel Donnelly (Maggie Smith) is on the lookout for a cheap hip replacement. But then the doctor, for her, has to be English. 3 & 4) Douglas and Jean Ainslie (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton) who have made their unhappy marriage work just for the fear of society now have a financial crisis to deal with. 5) Retired judge Graham Dashwood (Tom Wilkinson) wants to get back to India in search of his love. 6) Madge Hardcastle (Celia Imrie) is out in search of companionship, while 7) Norman Cousins (Ronald Pickup) is all desperate to find someone for a one-night stand. What next? Destination: India calling. To be precise, it’s the Best Exotic Marigold hotel -- a hotel for the old and beautiful -- at Udaipur.<br>
<br>
Now just when you think this one is going to be yet another when-Hollywood-meets-India story, director John Madden proves you wrong. It’s more about hope (Evelyn at 60 is on the lookout for a BPO job). It’s all about the need to keep trying (Muriel not only gives up her wheel chair, but finds a new purpose in life). It’s all about diving into India -- a riot of noise and colour (Graham finds true joy in playing galli cricket with the local kids). Needless to say, all this would actually seem been-there-seen-that had it not been for the performances of the seven veterans. So much so, even the subplot of a budding romance, topped with an over-protective mom (Dev Patel-Lillete Dubey) seems unwanted. In fact, you can’t really tell who (amongst the seven) is better than the other. And it's not just serious stuff we’re talking about. Watch the bonding amidst some heart-felt emotions, dialogues, respective tales, fears... and English wit.<br>
<br>
But then, it’s the desi wit with its typical cliches -- roads full of camels, elephants; a bumpy crowded bus ride, a photoshop-ed hotel full of pigeons and cockroaches; the untouchable domestic help... that somewhat forces you to ask this: Does this (still) happen in India 2012?<br>
<br>
Seven people. Seven stories. Seven problems. Seven different reasons to travel to India... a country, as the movie says, where everything will be alright in the end. And alright it is! Now, that (surely) happens only in India!<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Wonder what happens when five Atlanta couples are caught in various stages of child birth? Read on....<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> You don’t really know what to expect from this multi-starrer bandwagon. Not because the movie boasts of some of the A-listers of Hollywood -- Elizabeth Banks, Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Rock, Ben Falcone, Brooklyn Decker ... among others -- but because the idea behind all that oh-my-god-I’m-pregnant screams and jumps stems from one of the bestselling pregnancy manual by the same name. The challenge for the filmmaker was to add a storyline to an otherwise plain to-do-or-not-to-do listings for those on the threshold of mommy-hood as well as daddy-hood. Well, it does meet that challenge... without sounding like a manual, and with some value added stuff. Of course, the chosen path is comedy.<br>
<br>
So first it’s time to make babies. And who's making them? Five couples: Evan (Matthew Morrison) and Jules (Cameron Diaz) who hook up in a dance show; Gary (Ben Falcone) and Wendy (Elizabeth Banks) who are now expecting are two years. Not far behind is Gary’s own dad Ramsey (Dennis Quaid), and his pretty new wife. The fourth couple is Alex (Rodrigo Santoro) and Holly (Jennifer Lopez) who are looking up to adopt an Ethiopian newborn, while Marco (Chace Crawford) and Rosie (Anna Kendrick) hit the nail on its head during a one-night stand. Next, it’s time for pregnancy tests. And finally, it's time to baby proof life by renovating rooms, going all blue and pink.<br>
<br>
Welcome to new age parenting where both moms and dads take pride in saying ‘We’re pregnant’, specially when they do not know what lies ahead. Perhaps, time to join a daddy-turned-baby-sitter club! Good fun till it's time for some pregnant pause. There are Pink slips. Heartbreaks. Tight budgets. And above all, long arguments on who ought to decide what the baby should be named... and things objectionable (at least in the long run).<br>

Who’s complaining? Definitely not those who know what to expect (out of their neonatal bookings) when they're expecting.

Not till he rubs Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) on the wrong side. 1972: Barnabas is set free from his coffin to return to his ancestral home... to realise things have changed for the worse. Time for action....<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Believe it or not, Edward Cullen is probably in for some serious competition for vampire Barnabas Collins is worth every penny. He, like all vampires, is not only thirsty for blood, but makes the whole blood-sucking thing look so natural. He has a gift of the gab – not only when it comes to quoting from Eric Segal's The Love Story, but also while using his long-nailed fingers, fangs and eyes to hypnotize his victims. He is a charmer not just for his looks – vampire, no vampire, every woman in town wants to bed him -- but for his Ps and Qs in place (any and every woman is ‘Madam’ for him). Also, when the libido is too high, he unabashedly indulges in a little quickie... rock and roll style. And if all that is not enough reasoning to convince you, here is one last try: Barnabas is actually Johnny Depp. Depp fans, the actor leaves you with no reason to complain. For the rest of you, watch Depp’s long spiel on something, everything and at times nothing, transform him into Collinwoods' happening vampire.<br>
<br>
The horror aside – there's nothing to make you bite your nails – <em>Dark Shadows </em>clearly works on three fronts. First, is the picturesque setting and visual effect. Presenting his drama in an out-an-out gothic backdrop, a time when witches, vampires, werewolves walked around as the living dead, Tim Burton poses a teaser: Legends are more beautiful than the truth.<br>
<br>
Next are the performances. The Collinwoods’ estate is full of family members who are representatives of skeletons in the closet of almost every next door family: Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeifer), her teenage rebel daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz), a drunk psychiatrist, Dr Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter). Each funny in their own way. But the one standing out is Eva Green who, as the sultry boardroom witch, epitomizes the hell hath no fury like a woman scorned funda in this dramedy.<br>
<br>
Lastly, it's the comic timing, courtesy the vampire himself. Depp has his own share of problems to deal with. What problems? The sight of a woman doctor! The urgency to find a husband for a fifteen-year-old! Can’t really blame him for the generation gap now that he returns after 200 years. For the remaining loops (a little in the second half), it’s the music that takes over -- My First, My Last, Top Of the World, and one sung by.... Surprise! Surprise!<br>

After having swept you off your feet in seven different movies, the Burton-Depp duo return to tell us why this celluloid rendition of Dan Curtis’ soap opera was the talk of the town in the 1960s. For now, Burton creates some marvelous set pieces where the past intervenes with the present, while Depp creates a compelling picture of comic disarray.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> The fifteenth floor of a dilapidated building in Jakarta is now a safe house for the most notorious don in town. And why just a safe house? The apartment has also been a no-go area for one and all for the last decade. Time for a new SWAT team to break into the building... and take the drug lord to task.<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Here’s why you might want to skip this one: the dialogues are barely there (at the most 30 lines in all); the cast has never been heard of (and seen) before; the film, at least in India, has been pretty low on publicity. But before you decide to do that, here’s why you -- specially the hardcore action buffs -- might want to watch this: there’s violence, blood and gore, heads banged against walls, head banged against head, martial-arts unlimited, hard kicking, bone-crushing, neck twisting.... So with all that noise satisfying your quench for action, the lack of dialogues does not really make a difference.<br>
<br>
The plot, right in the very first shot, promises something to look forward to. A SWAT team, lead by its Lieutenant, is all out to get hold of Tama, who is something of a legend in the underworld. But then challenges are aplenty - guards, a narcotics lab, guns, and most importantly, once you get in, there’s just no way out, literally. That's what keeps you glued to your seats as you crave to get to the end of things: how exactly do the heroes reach the fifteenth floor. But then, in its fight to the top, all logic seems lost. The only logic is that of deathly blows, inhumanity, corruption and deceit. But who’s complaining? Not those who like to see their silver screen turn into a bloody, MMA ring.<br>
<br>
In this day and age when the whizzing of bullets and explosion of bombs bring an end to the vicious war lords on screen, here is your chance to indulge is some raw action. As the bad guys put it: ‘Never liked using this (the gun). It takes away the rush. This is the pulse.’<br>
<br>
Over to the pulse (read knives, swords, ropes, chains... and punch-to-punch, fist-to-fist, bang-to-bang, head-to head bashing sessions.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Logan Thibault walks all the way from Colorado to Hampton in search of the woman he thinks was his lucky charm while he was serving as war soldier in Iraq....<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review</strong>: The problem with screen adaptations of novels written by Nicholas Sparks is that if it’s not bang on (in story and spirit), it might get Nicholas fans a little disappointed. Remember Nights in Rodanthe? And if it's minor changes in the plot that we’re talking about, as in The Lucky One, we don't really know how Nicholas fans are set to react.<br>
<br>
Logan Thibault (Zac Efron), a marine having served three tours in the Iraq war finally decides to call it quits. But before that he has an unfinished task: He is hell bent on finding the woman whose picture he has been carrying all throughout the war. For the record, his friend and now he himself, feels that it’s Beth’s picture which has been saving grace, literally. So out he is on a mission to find his lady luck, meet her and as Dame Fortune would have it, fall for her. But then love, as we know, has never really been that simple.<br>
<br>
The setting is perfect: the woody countryside, streams running into nowhere and a laidback life led by the inhabitants. Coming from one of the best selling contemporary romantic authors, this romantic plot is nothing short of perfect. The performances good: Zac, like Logan in the pages, is a man of few words, seldom smiles and is pretty cool at his job -- walking the dogs. Taylor Schilling’s Beth, again like the pages, has her highs and lows as she goes about proclaiming to be a 'damn-good-mother'.<br>
<br>
But all said and done, something still seems to be missing out there. Now what is it? Is it Logan who in the very first meeting with Beth (unlike the book) is ready to play plot spoiler? Or is it director Scott Hicks who (unlike the book) does not let the romance and Sparks-ian mush brew between the two love birds? Or is it the bonding (unlike the book) between the nanny and her granddaughter that never really happens? Or finally, is it Zeus (the loyal dog) who (unlike the book) barely has screen time, leave alone being the hero in the end? Yes, the hero is someone else here.<br>
<br>
Now, don't go looking for The Notebook and A Walk to Remember, and you might not end up complaining.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Once upon a time there was boy named Hugo Cabret who lived in a train station. Despite being single and young, he searched hard to find a secret message from his father. The message, like magic, reached all the way to the right person, till dreams were re-lived.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> For the time being, let's keep all this aside: After having released in the U.S last year, Hugo finally releases in India today. Hugo went on to nab 11 nominations and five Oscars this year. With Hugo, director Martin Scorsese for the first time ever enters three-dimensional territory. Instead, let's talk of this: The Eiffel Tower of the 1930s has never looked so inviting; the snow falling atop the wooden roofs and window panes of old France has never looked so mesmerizing; the world of clocks has never seemed so hi-tech. For starters, Hugo is a visual treat. And now we know why it grabbed the Oscar for Best Visual Effect this year.<br>
<br>
But then adding life to all that eye candy is Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield), the orphan boy in town, who lives in a railway station, steals croissants, and gets his five minutes of laughter when he spots the odd ones out at the station when peeping from the huge clock tower. Like all restless kids, Hugo too is on the lookout for his 'purpose' which in this case is understanding the secret message his dad (an unfortunately hardly-there Jude Law cameo) brought forth by an old piece of automaton. Helping him in his purpose is yet another kid, Isabella (Chloe Grace Moretz). For her, the 'purpose' is rather simple: adventure calling. Fun while the two are out coding and decoding messages, sketches, and looking out for the right key to get the automaton started. Once functional, you realise there is much more to the movie -- the true story of turn-of-the-century French pioneer filmmaker Georges Melies, all his surviving films, his collection of mechanical models called automata, his determination of making dreams (filmmaking) come true.<br>
<br>
Now, for the ideation. Hugo lives up to the pages it owes its creation to – Brian Selznick’s The Invention of Hugo Cabret. And why just the plot, Martin Scorsese ensures even the feel of the movie is in sync with the literary version. With 284 pictures between the 533 pages, the book appeals to all for its words as well as pictures. With hardly any dialogues, the movie depends equally on its performance as it does on the picturesque setting. Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz are quite successful in taking you back to the Dickensian era... and perhaps a 1930 version of Potter's 9-3-4 platform. Watch Asa go all out to give Chloe her first taste of real adventure – they sneak into a cinema hall. Watch Chloe kiss Asa for the first time ever on his cheeks – something that makes our kid grow up. But the real winner is Ben Kingsley who, as the owner of a small toy shop, 'fixes' whatever little seems to be amiss, both when it comes to machines... and the silent pauses.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Mei (Catherine Chan) is wanted by all -- the Triads... The Russian mob... The NYC super and corrupt cops. Why? She has the secret code to the safe. Enter Luke Wright (Jason Statham), her protector... and the one who ultimately gets access to the safe.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> It's a Jason Statham movie where the actor is once again seen paving his way to victory while sorting the good from the bad. So no prizes for guessing what lies in store: gun firing in loads and fist fights in aplenty. Add to that some Statham-ism and there's no looking back. Now, how many actors do we have out there who pick up call girls in NYC, pay them plenty of that dollar, get an entry into a sizzling restaurant and ask them to leave immediately. Or for that matter, how many Medowlands (New Jersey) ex-fighters do we have dressed in an executive suit breaking tracheas of the bad guys. Statham fans, there’s enough of the suave in here.<br>
<br>
But then, Jason Statham has competition in Safe. And this competition is a pretty tough one for it comes from the little Catherine Chan. With hardly any dialogues (in English) to herself, Chan actually keeps you asking for more each time she (or Statham) are missing in action. In fact, it's not just her computerised memory that helps her remember all important bank transactions in the Chinese world, it's her ultimate understanding of the big bad biz world (she excels in distinguishing between good business and the bad one) that takes you by surprise. Make sure you catch Catherine’s Mei calling the shots – in every way – in the last sequence.<br>
<br>
Of course, the two (Statham and Catherine) together make this gang war for the green bills in the bustling narrow bylanes of New York’s China Town worth a watch. The action, on the other hand, is crispy and smart. As for the storyline, guess it was always meant to tread on safe ground... nothing that you have never seen before.

So you obviously know what to expect -- car chases, gun shots and swearing unlimited. But then what you really do not expect turns out to be the highpoint of 21 Jump Street.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> The evil Queen is all out to ruthlessly rule her kingdom. Till Princess Snow White - along with her prince charming and the seven dwarfs - takes control.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all? Well, this time it's not Snow White, but the evil Queen herself. Yes, there have been many Snow White fairly tales that have cast their spell on Hollywood's silver screen in the past, but then never ever have we witnessed this fairy tale from the POV of the evil Queen. This is perhaps your chance to know what happens to the not-so-fairy-Queen (Julia Roberts) in fairyland.<br>
<br>
The Queen has cast a spell on the king, she now wants to marry a young Prince... who just can't take his eyes of Princess Snow White (Lily Collins). Snow White is on a mission to save her kingdom from the evil shackles of the Queen, of course with the help of the seven dwarfs and the love of her life, Prince Alcott (Armie Hammer). This is what we know. Now for what we do not know. Prince Alcott and Princess Snow White in the new ice age meet in a rather 'compromising' situation. The Queen stammers and just cannot take her eyes off the young Prince each time he appears shirtless. Snow White takes pride in defeating her Prince Charming in a battle of the swords -- if need be she is all out to punch him too. Though a figure of utmost righteousness, Snow White does not hesitate to 'steal' (read kidnap) her Mr Right to lip lock for the first time ever, and ultimately settle down in marriage. Lastly, no one here seems to believe in the most apt fairy tale concept of living peacefully ever after. It's naach gaana Bollywood style, courtesy desi director Tarsem Singh, that finally brings an end to the great royal tamasha. Different. Contemporary. Interesting.<br>
<br>
But then how apt is Julia as the epitome of a conniving Queen? Well, her evilness comes with a sense of humour. Though her costumes give her the need-of-the-hour royale touch (ironically she looks prettier than the princess), for most of the time you end up thinking this: Is this Queen straight out of the pages of My Best Friend's Wedding? Case in point, she going weak in the knee each time she spots her prince charming in a semi nude (read shirtless) avatar. More than being hated for being evil - she's barely vicious -- you actually end up sympathising (and laughing) with her specially when she just can't get her man to love her... and sleep with her. In fact, it is her mirror image and the final shot with the forbidden fruit in hand that somewhat sends a chill down your spine. Next is Lily Collins, who in her urge to I-can-fight-my-battle-alone syndrome, loses out on the little nuances of a perfect fairy tale heroine. She is not shy. She is not coy. She is not dainty. As for Armie's Prince Alcott, a love potion gone wrong is more than what he (and you) can perhaps take. He turns into a puppy kinda figure with a knack to lick all things human... and pant around. Lastly, wonder what is it about the dwarfs that we just can't get ourselves to say 'oh-so-cute'.<br>
<br>
Agreed it's new. Agreed it's different. Agreed it's year 2012. And agreed it's the fairy tale from the evil Queen's perspective. But then is this Hollywood's Snow White tale really the fairest of them all? Got to wait and watch, specially when there's another Snow White (and the Huntsman) coming soon....

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> An international naval fleet out to give its new fighters on board a taste of naval exercise ends up waging war of the real kind... not with neighbouring countries, but the extra terrestrials.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>The first reason why you’d like to rush to the nearest cinema to watch this one? Battleship releases a month before the United States of America. Nah! You’d rush to see your ultimate Hasbro combat game come alive on screen. But before that, here’s a warning: Some fifty odd minutes into the movie and this is what you witness – Lt. Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) is a happy-go-lucky-youth who does not mind rubbing the cops on the wrong side just to get a chicken hamburger for his girl, Samantha (Brooklyn Decker). Enough to win over his lady love, but not much to convince her dad, Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson). For him, it’s about winning bigger battles. Just when the naval fleet at Pearl Harbor, under the command of apna ‘Carter’ Kitsch, engages in a deadly battle against the foes from outer space who are here to rob Earth of its power resources. That’s where you see Kitsch play hero in every sense of the word as he prepares, strategises and leads his troops to victory. Now, if you can last this bit of screen time, rest assured, the fun just begins.<br>
<br>
Yes, Battleship does have enough battles for all gaming buffs out there. There is endless non-stop action, unlimited explosions, adrenaline pumping moments, balls of fire, weird looking creatures, edge-of-the-seat and do-or-die moments. There are also plasma screens spotting the super fast coming of the aliens from under water, NY roads cracking up, cars being destroyed, Hong Kong skyscrapers turning into dust, helicopters being blasted, bright blue signals in the dark pacific ocean. In simple words, this one’s PS3 on the big screen. Add to that the use of several real Navy ships and Navy war skills and you don’t really complain about yet another been-there-seen-that battle for Planet Earth from Hollywood.<br>
<br>
Of course, for the just-not-unfaithful fans, here’s one more reason to watch this one. Pop icon Rihanna makes her debut as the confident Petty Officer Raikes, who makes you almost jump from the seat with her first (and sadly last) blow to the alien on the hunt. Now she might not have her oohs and aahs in place here – she’s a tomboy in uniform – but then you do end up saying please don’t stop the music (read raw action on screen), Rihanna!

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> The love story between commoner Jack Dawson ( Leonardo DiCaprio) and aristocratic Rose Dewitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), set against the ornate yet tragic backdrop of the sinking luxury liner, sends out all the right signals. It talks of a love that is passionate, permanent, soul stirring, death defying and powerful enough to break all barriers of class and destiny.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> It took some 300 hundred people, 60 weeks, 279,000 frames and $18 million more (initially costing some $200 million) for director James Cameron to sink the Titanic all over again. Not to say, his earlier Titanic (1997) did not have its fair share of numbers to deal with: a movie stretching to 194 minutes; a movie bagging 11 Oscars that year. The fact that James Cameron managed to blend steamy romance with mind-blowing depiction of disaster made the film even more spectacular. Watching the Titanic sink, with all the attendant creaks and cracks, was truly a milestone moment in movie lore. That was then. For now, the Big Question: What is it that really makes Titanic (1997) look all different from Titanic (2012)?<br>

<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> There’s always scope for improvement. There’s ample scope for the clash (2010: Clash of the Titans) to turn into some real action-packed wrath (2012: Wrath of the Titans). Here’s calling all you Clash of the Titans buffs who just could not wait to see their second dose of video game push button fantasy come alive on the big screen.<br>
<br>
So what’s cooking between the Gods and the Titans this time? The same old war for the I’m-the-best title. But unlike its previous years, the Gods are losing control of humanity and taking over are the badmaash Titans and the deadly giant-sized Kronos. That’s where our been-there-done-that hero from the past, son of the all-powerful Zeus (Liam Neeson), Perseus (Sam Worthington) steps in to put up yet another spectacular show with the spear of Tritum -- the only weapon that can kill the one who shall not be named. Of course, there’s a gamut of labyrinths and changing loyalties (Ralph Fiennes’s Hades and Edgar Ramirez’s Ares) he has got to deal with first.<br>
<br>
Back to all Clash of the Titans fans. Don’t go expecting for a storyline that’ll make you go all hail Liebesman. After all, when was this Gods versus Titans versus Demi Gods series all about a colossal plot anyway. But then here is what makes up for the same. First, it’s the edgy action cuts -- the coming soon calamity drama, fist fights with fire exploding beasts, two headed beasts, unheard of and unseen before beasts, the fight between the one-eyed Cyclopes (who literally tears out of the screen) and our war heroes, the will-Perseus-won’t-Perseus-make-it on time situations, the ultimate falling of the Kronos, explosions unlimited. Then there is the element of the mysterious -- the island of Kail, the labyrinth leading to the dark dungeon of the underworld called Tartarus, the Kronos made out of a huge, huge mound of lava -- the falling of which gives this sequel an epic finale. Next is the ultimate hero, the demi God. This time it’s not just Sam Worthington who seems to have mastered the art of fighting with the evil Gods, but also Toby Kebbell as son of Poseidon. Toby’s God-turned-man avatar, Agenor, comes with a rather mortal sense of humour. Lastly, it’s a message rather loud and clear -- Not that the Gods must die too. Not even that man will be all powerful provided he uses his power wisely. It’s the possibility of yet another sequel -- watch the sword of honour being passed from Father (Zeus)... to son (Perseus)... to son (Helius).<br>
<br>
A word about the 3D effects. Definitely not much to make the Gods happy, but surely enough to send the message -- of wrath -across to us mortals.<br>
<br>
An improvement.

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The expectations are pretty high on this one. No prizes for guessing why. The Hunger Games, the movie, is based on the bestselling young adult novel by Suzanne Collins. Naturally then, like the book, the film raises some thought provoking questions often read between the lines all throughout its screenplay. Will the next World War be all about food? Are most of the government strategies all about playing big brother to the common man? Will the on-going crisis the world over -- Iraq, Syria, Somalia, to name some -- ever reach a fruitful conclusion? Are reality games tweaked to pump up TRP ratings? How much is too much when it comes to seeking all that audience support (votes) in a reality show? Will survival of the fittest be the only driving force in the world that lies ahead?

<br>
All is fair in love and war. And all is fair in love, war... and dating. Or so it seems, for FDR Foster (Chris Pine) and Tuck (Tom Hardy) who are CIA agents and best buddies with a dual mission: win over the woman they both claim to be falling in love with -- Lauren (Reese Witherspoon) -- and keep the friendship going no matter who gets the girl. Now it’s just when the gentlemen’s agreement goes kaput does all the war (of words) in the movie come into play. In fact, more than who wins the girl, it’s the how-they-win-the-girl that keeps the funny bone tickled on and off. Take for instance FDR Foster who gets his knowledge of Gustav Klimt mixed up with the objectionable and Tuck who puts up a fake action stunt to show he is not ‘just the caring’ type. Not to miss out is Trish (Chelsea Handler) who unabashedly concludes the best way to fall for a guy is to check him out in bed!

Well, to greater love stories, specially when it involves the likes of Leo (Channing Tatum) and Paige (Rachel McAdams) who (in The Vow) are seen falling into love all over... and over again.<br>

Paige, a rebel in her own right, chooses to walk away from home and friends, simply to live life on her own terms. And that's when she falls for the not-so-successful Leo, gets married and makes it a point to dine with him on every snowy, winter night. Just the time when ill fate strikes -- she meets with a near fatal accident... is luckily back into action but without any memory of her love for Leo. Time for Leo to make his lady love fall for him again. Easy? Not really.<br>
<br>
The formula The Vow applies to make one fall in love all over again is simple: Moments! Moments is what one needs to relive.... Moments of impact define who we are. As for your moments of romantic bliss, there are a couple of 'aaaahhh' moments, though felt after long gaps. Case in point, Channing Tatum's Leo who first is seen as the epitome of patience trying to get his wife to follow the normal routine till he ultimately refuses to be her punching bag. Not to miss is his struggle doubled with his wife's mean parents and ex fiancee, Jeremy's (Scott Speedman) re-entry into her life. Next is Rachel McAdams as the blanked out wife who just can't understand why she chose to marry a struggling musician. Greencard, perhaps! We, however, wish there were a few more 'moments' to carry back home.

<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> So what if this movie is based on the book -- Princess of Mars -- by Edgar Rice Burroughs written some 100 odd years ago. Nothing could have made it more topical in a day and age when 21st century science is all out to crack Da Martian Code by stepping foot on planet Mars. And if Andrew Stanton's visualisation of the planet in John Carter is anything to go by, bingo is the word. Yes, the Red Planet has never looked so inviting. The Martian landscape is exotic, mysterious, mesmerising. The Martians themselves, more than convincing.<br>
<br>
John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) is an American War soldier who has superhuman powers -- Mars gravity, to name one. Reason enough from him to be transported to the planet Barsoom (read Mars)? No, for there are bigger problems awaiting his arrival. Carter is caught in a conflict of epic sorts amongst the green skinned warlike nomads (Tharks) and the red skinned humanoids (Martians). To be precise, Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe) and the captivating Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins). Of course, it is only later that Carter acknowledges the need for being blessed with all that superhuman powers -- he’s got to save the locals.<br>
<br>
Now just when you thought that John Carter is all about a fierce battle, you realise there is a whole lot to choose from. First, it's the Martian character Woola, John Carter's ugly but cute pet, you just can’t get enough of. Second is the no nonsense ideology brought out by the age old war between the good versus evil. Third is the superhero in touch with his emotional side -- Carter rescues Dejah from the clutches of the Zodagans simply for love. Watch out for the Kitsch-Collins chemistry. Fourth is the 3D effect -- Zodangan's moving city, the dragonfly-like aircraft.... Fifth it's Taylor Kitsch himself (as John Carter) with his action cuts who turns out to be Burroughs' most apt Martian Tarzan.<br>
<br>
And if that’s not all, John Carter is your ticket to travel to a whole -- waiting to be explored -- new world, literally: Planet Mars.

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> A thick, dark smoke hangs over Oskar Schell's (Thomas Horn) young heart since his father Thomas (Tom Hanks) died in the WTC attack. He bonded with his father and hates his mother. 'I wish you were in the building instead of him,' Oskar tells his mom. And he feels that the path to redemption could lie in a yellow key that one day he accidentally stumbles upon. The key was kept in an envelope in a blue vase and addressed to someone named Black. And the boy, both articulate and sensitive, makes it his mission to find its lock.<br>
<br>
But in a city of over 400 listed Blacks, that's not easy. The movie takes Oskar to different people and places in the city: the Afro-American woman trapped in a bad marriage, the man who can't stop hugging him, the cranky woman who shoos him away. Midway in the endeavour, he makes friends with an old man who has stopped speaking by choice. It is an interesting relationship of unequals. Together they scan the city and the travels become a sort of therapy for both.<br>
<br>
Fashioned for celluloid from a novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close proceeds languidly like food being cooked overnight on slow fire. It is about loss, coping and illumination. Slowly the story of a boy's reconciliation with his self and his mother also becomes a moving tale of a city and everyone who lived through 9/11.<br>
<br>
A meaner editor could have trimmed director Stephen Daldry's movie by 10 minutes making it a tighter, neater work. In small roles, Hanks and Bullock are in fine fettle. So is Max Von Sydow in the role of a grandfather. But as the argumentative and intelligent kid, Thomas Horn is the movie's real spine. His journey for the key's lock is both outward and inward. And sometimes it is also magical.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> A biographical feature on Margaret Thatcher, the longest serving British Prime Minister of the 20th century.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The early 1980s were difficult times in Britain. Unemployment, recession, trade union strikes, IRA terrorism - those were hard times when Margaret Thatcher became the country's first woman prime minister in 1979. By the time she quit in 1990, the Russians had fondly dubbed her The Iron Lady and Britain had changed irrevocably.<br>
<br>
Much of the drama and trauma that the nation underwent during her tenure in the 1980s is glossed over in director Phyllida Lloyd's venture. A few placards in grainy television footages, for instance, isn't enough to capture the famous miner's strike of 1984-85 which was one of the defining events in her career. The movie merely skims the surface of all that Britain underwent; instead it chooses to focus on the personality of Thatcher. There is no complexity or counterpoint on offer.<br>
<br>
Luckily director Lloyd has Meryl Streep in the protagonist's part. Streep's magnetic performance makes up for the script's shallowness. You are simply left marveling what an actor and her makeup artist can achieve with their work. Streep and her long-standing makeup man J Roy Helland -- both earned Oscars for their work in the film - almost make us believe as if we are watching the real Thatcher in action.<br>
<br>
Streep not only captures the walk, the gait, the voice and the diction of the former British Prime Minister but also the changes in Thatcher's personality that comes with her growing confidence on the job. The early hesitancy is replaced with authority and arrogance. The sharp physical contrast between Thatcher as Prime Minister and the frail, faltering Thatcher of later years, who keeps talking to her dead husband, is stunning.<br>
<br>
But a movie is much more than its actors. The story of a grocer's daughter who tells her would-be husband, 'I cannot die washing tea cups,' who conquers a men's bastion, who gives the go-ahead to sink the Argentinian cruiser General Belgrano during the Falklands war, could easily have been a much more compelling and nuanced narrative.<br>
<br>
But Lloyd prefers to rely on the power of the one-liners that Thatcher tossed with abandon like her good friend US President Ronald Reagan -- 'It is time to put great back in Great Britain,' 'Yes, the medicine is harsh, but the patient requires it in order to live, 'We will all stand on principle or we will not stand at all.' It sounds good but it doesn't touch anything deep.<br>
<br>
As a movie, The Iron Lady would have been dumped in the category of less-than-satisfying biopics. But Streep and Helland have not only ensured that the movie engages the regular viewer; they have also made it must-watch in every acting workshop; hence an afterlife.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> A woman kills three priests during an act of exorcism. Nearly 20 years later, her daughter tries to find out what happened to her while making a film on exorcism.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> A Bollywood hit often spawns a legion of poor imitators. It is not too different in Hollywood. Movies such as The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity have generated a bevy of similar copycat projects where footage found from a handheld camera becomes the film's story. The Devil Inside walks the same line.<br>
<br>
This is primarily a film on exorcism. In the 1970s global superhit, The Exorcist, priests read out from the Bible to rid a girl of evil. But the priests in The Devil Inside are New Age and tech savvy. They monitor heartbeat and blood pressure. And they record everything on camera. To Isabella Rossi (Fernanda Andrade), the young filmmaker who wants to find out about her mother languishing in a Catholic psychiatric hospital, they say, 'You can find out more about her in five minutes of exorcism than three months of class.'<br>
<br>
This is a movie where expressions like 'hierarchy of demons,' 'multiple demonic possession' and 'transference' of spirits are part of regular conversation. And it is all done with a handheld camera, often in dimly lit rooms, to create the illusion of watching genuine footage of a documentary.<br>
<br>
The Devil Inside does not use gimmicks. The scenes of exorcism, where the victims are possessed by demons, do have a strange kind of pull. They seem real and that's what makes them occasionally scary. The movie does create an atmosphere of uneasiness though. But overall it fails to engage.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Two schoolboys fight and one of them emerges with two broken teeth. Their parents meet for reconciliation in a New York apartment. The meeting is stormy.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Bullets don't fly in Carnage. Nobody gets stabbed or gunned down. The violence in director Roman Polankshi's film -- based on the play, God of Carnage by Yasmina Reza -- is of a different kind. Two sets of parents, meeting each other for the first time to thrash out a fight between their kids, end up savaging each other with words. Once the veneer of civility is stripped off under the strain of the unfortunate incident, the Longstreets (Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly) and the Cowans (Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz) hurl words like harpoons meant to pierce the heart. Soon the kids and the issue linked with them become irrelevant.<br>
<br>
Frayed nerves, bloated egos and papered up cracks within their own relationships come to the fore. Gender alliances are formed and broken. At one point Michael (Reilly) and Allan (Waltz) face each other like two mafia dons about to shoot each other. Under strain, Nancy (Winslet) vomits over Penelope's (Foster) favorite art books. And it doesn't help that they are all sipping 18-year-old single malt at the same time.<br>
<br>
For adults only, Carnage is gripping drawing room drama. The film entirely focuses on the conversation between the four adults and the action never moves out of the Longstreet apartment in New York. And it is a tribute to the quality of screenplay, co-written by Polanski and Reza, that you never feel the need for outdoors. There's dark humour too.<br>
<br>
In the end, the movie becomes a scathing critique of civility and people. The Polish director seems to suggest that civility is a luxury few can afford under pressure. And, in fact, people are too eager to strip it off because it makes them feel more comfortable with their real selves.<br>
<br>
In an illustrious career, Polanski has made a cache of unforgettable movies such as Knife in the Water, Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby and The Pianist. With polished performances by the entire cast -- Foster and Waltz marginally more persuasive than the other two -- Carnage is another Polanski special in its own way.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> The year is 1956. Young Colin Clark is keen to enter the movie world. And he is excited when he gets a job as third-assistant director in a film that actor Laurence Olivier is directing. Marilyn Monroe is the leading lady. A close encounter follows. The film is based on Clark's real-life account.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The shooting has been wrapped up and he is at the bar sipping beer. There's a murmur of disbelief all round as she steps into the bar, walks up to him and says, 'I just wanted to say goodbye before leaving. Don't forget me.' He doesn't know what to say and mumbles, 'As if I could.'<br>
<br>
Nobody touched by the Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams) charm ever could. Certainly not Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne) who wrote about his friendship with the actor in a book of the same name. Working as a lowly assistant director, 23-year-old Clark is assigned to do a host of odd jobs that gets him in touch with the enigmatic star.<br>
<br>
The actor, going through a troubled marriage, fighting depression and anxiety and Olivier's meanness, finds an unlikely chum in Clark. In him, she finds a straightforwardness that perhaps helps her forget all she wants to. It is an intimate, brief encounter. They swim naked together in a pond and exchange a kiss. 'I want this to be the perfect date. I haven't had a date since I was 13 years old,' she says. It is something like a crush for him and perhaps the passing madness of a summer afternoon for her.<br>
<br>
The movie looks at the relationship from Colin's point of view and makes him a young gentleman who offers to rescue Marilyn only to be refused. But My Wweek with Marilyn also brings out the inner loneliness and anxiety of the world's most famous woman of the time. It brings out all that she values and wants. 'I would have never sent my kids away to boarding school,' she says at one point. Portraying Marilyn isn't easy but Michelle Williams brings out the complexity of her life to her face though she fails to bring out the unselfconscious appeal and magic of the star.<br>
<br>
Director Simon Curtis's effort shows that the movie business makes wrecks of everybody. Marilyn succumbed to its poison but even Vivien Leigh (Julia Ormond) and Sir Lawrence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh) are damaged within. Through Colin, the movie brings out the interesting point that Olivier was an actor who wanted to become a star whereas Marilyn was a star who wanted to be an actor. That's where the two differed in their interpretations of the role during the shooting of The Prince and the Showgirl. In the end, Olivier concedes that while he is trained in the craft, she is pure instinct. 'She remains brilliant, despite me,' he says.<br>
<br>
Filmed partly in the picture postcard British countryside, the movie is another elegy to the legend of Marilyn Monroe. It is also an ode to young love. At the end of it all when a wise old actor tells Collins, 'First love is sweet despair,' we understand what she means.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> A black and white love story of a fading star of the silent movies and a rising heroine of the talkies set in late 1920s and early 30s.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> In the cinema of silence, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is king. He doesn't need the sound of words. With his mobile face and elastic body, he brings any emotion to life. He doesn't care much for his co-stars; the only actor he is willing to share screen space with is his dog (Uggy). The audience laughs uproariously at anything he does. And that translates into box-office winners, which is why the studio bosses bow to his whims.<br>
<br>
But all good things must come to an end. And when the talkies arrive, Valentin suddenly becomes a pre-historic dinosaur. 'You and I belong to another era, George,' the studio boss says. Change creates victims, especially those who resist it. And Valentin is one of them. He believes in the silent movies and makes one too. But it bombs.<br>
<br>
Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) is the flipside of change. The starlet is the new vanilla of the season. In times of the silent movies, she had a crush on Valentin and he liked her too. But as she goes up the ladder, Valentin becomes a prisoner of his past. Pride becomes his prejudice. He clings to his ego like a cripple hangs on to a crutch. And he becomes a leper in his own mind, refusing everything, including acting parts and love. How can you rescue someone who's enjoying a free fall into the abyss?<br>
<br>
If we still love George Valentin despite his flaws and transgressions, it is because actor Jean Dujardin has made him irresistible with his wicked moustache, gelled hair, rakish charm and to-die-far tap dancing moves. But, more than that, he gets the style and mannerism in synchronicity with the silent era. Even his smile seems to have been imported from 1920s.<br>
<br>
Yet The Artist is essentially a director's movie. It can be read as a simple romantic comedy or an allegory of social change. The pain of the silent movies star is the same for anyone and everyone rendered obsolete by technology. But this is also a daring movie. Making a black and white flick -- that too a no-dialogue movie -- requires supreme belief. But for the occasion when the dialogues are splashed in bold capital on screen, we can only guess what the characters say. Yet the absence of dialogue in the modern way is never felt. Director Hazanavicius turns a courageous idea into textbook cinema.<br>
<br>
Leisurely paced and filmed in an old-fashioned way that reminds one of the best of Charlie Chaplin, The Artist is a tribute to silent cinema, indeed to an age. The background music is stunningly evocative. And there's a certain grace and charm with which the movie has been made. The scene where Valentin first spots Miller, or just her dancing legs, behind a screen will endure in memory.<br>
<br>
Feted worldwide, the movie is in the race for 10 Oscars, including best picture, best director and best actor. The Artist makes you understand, what a philosopher once said, 'If you can't understand my silence, you won't understand my words.'

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> With a modest budget at his disposal, the general manager of a professional US baseball club dreams of putting together a team that can outfox and outplay the cash-rich big clubs.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> In 2007, Rajasthan Royals were the unlikely winners of the first IPL. On paper, the club co-owned by actress Shilpa Shetty looked the weakest without any million-dollar glamour boys in the unit. But as the championship progressed, the team generated a sweet rhythm that reached its crescendo in the final. What was the secret ingredient that made RR such a force of nature that season? Was it captain Shane Warne's leadership ability that made every player play beyond his ability? Or was it something else - because the success wasn't replicated?<br>
<br>
The world of sports is filled with romantic stories of triumph against odds. Based on a book by Michael Lewis, Moneyball is one of the finest in the genre of sports dramas. Director Bennett Miller's film is a real-life, gut-wrenching guided tour through the heart and soul of Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), the general manager Oakland Athletics baseball team and everything his team accomplished in the season of 2002.<br>
<br>
Money talks, especially in the world of professional sports. Top clubs believe dollars buy you dreams. That's why they shell out millions for the superstars. Beane doesn't have the big bucks. And he has just lost three of his marquee players to bigger clubs. 'We are like the organ donors for the rich,' he tells his scouts. What Beane doesn't lack is commitment to the game and an ambition to beat the best. And pushed into a corner, he is bent on finding a novel -- and economical -- way to do it.<br>
<br>
And when he finds Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a graduate in economics from Yale, with a statistical theory that suits his budget, the two form an unlikely team. Together they recruit a bunch of under-valued players, 'misfit toys' who have the potential to be match-winners. That's what the term, moneyball, a much-debated word in baseball, boils down to.<br>
<br>
But translating theory into practice isn't easy. After their initial failure, the baseball system is dismissive of Beane and Brand. They have bought tickets on a Titanic, scoffs a critic. And Beane is battling his own private demons of the past too. He is a failed prodigy. And this is his last chance to create a thinking revolution in baseball and prove that money doesn't always talk.<br>
<br>
Baseball isn't India's game. And the movie is riddled with baseball jargon. But the beauty of Moneyball lies in being able to transcend itself to a universal drama of collective redemption. It isn't easy fusing the fortune of a baseball team with the private life of its general manager. Director Miller makes every frame count, including smartly blending the thread of Beane's relationship with his daughter. The narrative flows like's Oakland's play towards the end. With the acting ensemble too in fine fettle, you stay riveted to the fortunes of the coach and his team, though, even though the baseball jargon escapes you. Moneyball is studded with diamonds in more than one way.<br>
<br>
Pitt is absolutely convincing in the part of the man on a mission. As his assistant, the portly Hill suitably underplays the role. Both have earned Oscar nominations; Pitt for best actor and Hill for best supporting actor. In all, Moneyball has been nominated for six Academy awards, including best picture. IPL owners need to take a long, hard look at the movie and at the methods of Billy Beane.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Johnny Blaze continues to hide in Eastern Europe. A secret sect of the church wants him to save a boy from the shackles of the devil. Can Blaze once again make the good win over evil, specially now that he is reluctant to use his power?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Boy oh boy! The Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze/Nicolas Cage) is back... this time to set the screen ablaze, literally! There’s more action, more speed runs, more bombing, more hi-tech equipment (sulphur guns and bombs), more biking craze, more screaming, more pacts with the devil, more good versus evil wars, more special effects 3D style... and much more Nicolas Cage. Yes, watch your Johnny blaze the screen with more adrenaline-fuelled stunts, moments and ideas. Don’t miss out the add on: The man who does not want to live in fear this time comes with a sense of humour. Case in point: He shows us how a guy could possibly ease himself when on fire!<br>
<br>
Johnny Blaze is still coping with his curse as the devil’s hunter. All he wants is to get rid of the tag for which he is ready to pay any price. In this case, it’s protecting Satan’s human son, Danny (Fergus Riordan), from the devil, Roarke (Ciaran Hinds). Now, he does save the kido (no prizes for guessing that!)... but at what cost?<br>
<br>
Back to Nicolas. When he promised to be back with the spirit of vengeance in the prequel, little did we know that this time he would be ‘fighting fire with fire’. Watch out for moments when he dons the avatar of the Ghost Rider over... and over again. Not to say this Rider is low on the EQ. He still can’t get over how he failed to be a good son to a great father. So much so, he is even ready to attain nirvana by giving up on what makes him the man of the moment -- fire power.<br>
<br>
Just one word: Though Nicolas does keep the legend (read promise to keep all ghost riders out there entertained) going, one does miss a couple of things. The typical punch lines (Remember the good old ‘you-cannot-live-in-fear'?), the cool Ghost Rider (Remember Nicolas worried if his biking suit fit him well? Here, he is more on the irritated and angry side). And above all, Eva Mendes (as Roxanne Simpson) who brought in that extra humane touch. But then, we are just not complaining.<br>

<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The highs: Loads of gunshots, ruthless cop-criminal Q&A sessions, cars ramming into each other, long chases through the streets of Cape Town and the slums of Langa, smart and snazzy action cuts involving solid hand punches and enough energy to keep spirits up. The lows: Nothing that you have never seen before. But then are we complaining? Not really, especially when it’s Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds calling the shots.<br>
<br>
Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) overlooks a safe house where CIA agents can interrogate law breakers. In other words, when the protectors of law don’t really mind tweaking the law as long as they can get the truth out. But it does not take long for Matt to realise that the safe haven is hardly safe. Not because it is under attack by the warlords who want to take Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) to task, but because he realizes Frost is not what the law makers want him to be. What’s next? Mission Escape to a world where justice prevails. Before that, it’s sometimes running around stadiums and sometimes the chase between good guys and bad guys across busy streets. All this and more, till the two men on the run connect all the relevant pieces.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, it is Denzel Washington who once again is seen doing what he does best. His facial expressions and the goatee are enough to give that suave, convincing look of a man on the run... and a man who kills only professionals. Ryan does manage to stand at par (if not above) with Denzel Washington.<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> What do you possibly expect when it comes to a movie with a title as this one? Perhaps loads of slapstick humour. Well, don’t be surprised if you end up reading between the lines and getting some gyan on friendship, relationship, dating and love. Of course, there’s enough to titillate the human mind.<br>
<br>
Eric (Jason Sudekis) is a 30-year old happy-go-lucky youth who wants to make the last party at his favourite beach house different from all his previous parties held there. Obviously, nothing can be more daring than the infamous theme. But is it that simple? No, because he has a tedious task before him: 1)He has to convince his party buddies -- Duquez (Martin Starr), Adam (Nick Kroll), McCudden (Tyler Labine), Willow (Angela Sarafyan) and Alison (Lake Bell) -- to be a part of the wild evening. Here it’s difference of opinion: intimacy is about emotions and not the four letter word. 2) He has to settle on a theme to add to the charisma of the evening. From Brown Bread to Sting, it’s finally the Maharaja Indian theme that rules the chart. 3) The Big Q: What exactly does one do at a party like this! Watch the buddies take notes from videos, magazines and visit sex clubs to get a hands-on experience. Just the time when you get your dose of laughter. Add to that the uneasiness, take-a-deep-breath moments and the who-takes-the-lead situation when they meet on D-Day.... and the post party blues (read embarrassment).<br>
<br>
For the rest, it's all about food for thought -- social awkwardness, real moments, taking back what has been taken from the new generation, relationship issues, heartbreaks. The idea, of course, is to do what you feel happy doing.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Arthur Kipps is on a mission to a far off English village. He is out there to settle a complicated property dispute. Little does he know there are things more complicated (ghostly and creepy) awaiting his arrival.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Abracadabra! Avada Kedavra! The boy wizard has grown up. How else do you explain Daniel Radcliffe -- as a widower and busy-yet-caring father -- for pulling it off pretty well when there are hardly any dialogues to deliver... when everything depends on his expression (fear to be precise)... and when the real hero of the movie is none other than the woman in black. But then, who is this woman in black?<br>
<br>
Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) travels to the outskirts of England in order to sort out papers left at Eel Marsh House. But then it looks like the remote village is haunted by a vengeful ghost of a scorned woman -- always in black -- who is all out to terrorise the locals by killing their children. Naturally then, the most important task for the lawyer is to first get the killing of innocent lives under control. But how?<br>
<br>
Now what is it that keeps you glued to your seats till the very end? Daniel Radcliffe’s Kipps torn between the spiritual (he lost his wife during childbirth and now has visions of her in her wedding dress, aka his woman in white) and the supernatural (the woman in black who makes it a point to appear again and again till Daniel Radcliffe believes in ghosts). In fact, there are times when you wonder if this is the same Daniel Potter Radcliffe tweens could not get enough of. This is followed by the setting – dark, convincing, timeless. The haunted house in the middle of nowhere (literally) is enough to send chills down your spine. And if that’s not all, there is a lot of eeriness to choose from: the bad omen (black crow), creaking of an empty armchair, Daniel Radcliffe spotting the woman in black for the first time in the woods, amidst fire and across window panes, shadows being chased, empty corridors, Daniel peeping from the rooftop without realising there’s someone else peeping with him too. It's all in there – the horror -- and the mood first captured by British author Susan Hill in her 1982 novel by the same name.<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Agreed it's a remake of the 2008 French Film LOL: Laugh Out Loud, but then there are many reasons to watch LOL. First for its handling of teens and their issues aplenty: they want to look as if they do not care when they actually do; SMSing and FBing is what they swear by; they cope each day to love, live and LOL (Laugh Out Loud); they don’t mind drooling over teachers; first time crushes and virginity issues are their driving forces. And then there are more -- shapes of their assets, dealing with heartbreaks, infatuation.... On the other hand are parents with teens they find difficult to handle: the protective instinct of mothers; decoding teen lingo (and swear words); coping with teens who have iPods plugged into their ears just when they want to have a word or two; monitoring teens who want to get quick and dirty; ensuring teens make the right choice (bad lingerie is for girls with a bad future), teens and their diaries....<br>
<br>
Lola (Miley Cyrus) has just had a breakup when she starts finding love in Kyle (Douglas Booth). The two of course get on like a house on fire. But then teen love has never been that easy -- one misunderstanding leads to the other. Teen life too has never been that easy -- Lola has what she thinks is a helicopter mother to deal with simultaneously. After all, mom needs to know everything. All this and more till the two decide to let each other grow up. Generation gap, did we hear?<br>
<br>
If Miley Cyrus’s Lola does not care about the population of China but wants to hurt those who hurt her, Douglas Booth is perhaps the perfect guy every girl at Wrigley High School wants. But then it’s Demi Moore’s Anne that walks away with all the applause. Watch her as the confident liberal woman who thinks every woman has the right to sleep with the man she wants (In her case, it's her very own ex-hubby). Watch her as the not-so-confident liberal mother who wants her daughter to sleep with ‘only and only’ the right guy. In fact, Demi and Miley do bring out the special bond mothers and daughters share today, even in this online world. For the rest, it's over to the music -- I won't let you go, to name one.<br>

<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> It’s Circa 1914 -- a time when the Brits wore felt hats... a time when 30 guineas was all it took to buy a healthy horse at an auction... a time when landlords called the shots. But then the message Steven Spielberg’s War Horse gives out could not have been more contemporary -- why wage war when it leads to nothing. However, this time he chooses an animal (horse, to be precise), amidst the backdrop of the gruesome World War, to bring out the futility of war.<br>
<br>
Ted ( Peter Mullan) fetches an expensive purebred -- something that makes his wife Rose (Emily Watson) hate him more and his teenage son Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) love him more. No wonder Albert makes it a point to train Joey in a way that his family never regrets having the horse between them. So what follows next is human instinct taking over animal instinct: Watch Joey feed for the first time ever from human hand, respond to the human whistle and take up ploughing to ease things for his family. Cut to the war. Joey passes from one master to the other - British farmers, German soldiers, French farmers - till he is finally caught in the middle of WWI. And it’s during this journey of Joey that you actually pass through a series of devastating, disturbing and depressing shots of what a war does -- human bodies smeared in mud and blood; horses lying flat with eyes wide open.<br>
<br>
Not to say, it’s all about blood and gore in there. The orange sky amidst the lush green English countryside perfectly matched with some soothing music makes for ample visual appeal. Of course, one cannot miss out on the destructing, thought provoking visuals of war. Typically Spielberg. Remember Saving Private Ryan? Next is Jeremy Irvine who does manage to bring out the restlessness (and determination) of a teen who is just not willing to give up on Joey. But then it is Joey ultimately who comes out the real (war) hero. Not because Spielberg made it a point to essay fourteen different horses to portray the progression of Joey from colt to adult. Not even because he is worth every penny when galloping all panic-stricken through barbed wires. It’s for the ultimate humane message the animal gives out: We ought to be careful not to start a war.<br>

This time however, he threatens to jump off a high-rise building. Is that the end of the cop-turned-con man? Or does he have something else up his sleeve?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Women, says this movie, jump for love. And men? For money! That's exactly what Nick Cassidy is seen doing. Of course, the way he does it is what makes Man on a Ledge (and the view from the ledge) convincing and gripping. But before that you want to know why exactly Sam Worthington is on the ledge all through the movie.<br>
<br>
Nick Cassidy is a convict sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment for an alleged crime -- He stole Dave Englander's (Harris) prized diamond possession. But then is anyone out there ready to listen to an innocent ex super cop who otherwise pleads innocent? Not really. Next we see him stepping out onto the ledge of his hotel to get representatives of the law and the entire city to hear him out. Ironically, now that he has been labeled a con man, he does not mind doing the job for real: while he's at it on the ledge, there's a simultaneous heist for real happening alongside under his supervision. Exactly the moment that leaves you wondering what's up next.<br>
<br>
As for the thrill, most of it comes from the jumper himself. First he brings the busy street with its even busier traffic to a standstill. Next, it's people who do not mind capturing the moment on their iPhones to be the first ones to upload it on YouTube. Not to miss out is the perfect timing: each time the simultaneous heist is likely to make an explosive sound, Sam makes sure to take one step forward to make the crowd go into a frenzy. The outcome: a bigger noise. Lastly, it’s NYPD psychologist Lydia Mercer’s (Elizabeth Banks) tete-a-tete with the man in question that keeps you hooked on just when you’re on the lookout from some relief from the ledge - the conversation is cool, calm, smart, and of course, flirtatious.<br>
<br>
A special mention: Each time you realise how high up Sam is from the rest of the crowd -- and could possibly slip any moment (watch out the helicopter scene), you're in for some edge-of-the-seat moments. Yes, there’s no escaping the fear of a man standing on a ledge twenty-one floors above ground level.

Teenagers Andrew Detmer (DeHaan), Matt (Alex Russell) and Steve (Michael B. Jordan) think the best way to relive every day is to capture moments on a video camera. Naturally then they end up capturing a mysterious hole in the ground too. Perhaps a little reason to get disappointed for you don't really get to know what eerie stuff happens in there that eventually gives the boys predator like powers. But even before you can guess, the boys are all out doing what they have been longing since time immemorial -- slapping one and all, throwing toys off supermarket shelves and flying across the sky. So far so good till the actual realisation of power sets in. What follows next is time for destruction and time to own up to the mess.<br>
<br>
While the boys bring out the excitement of the next door teenagers (who get kicks out of simple pranks) and the I-am-the-master syndrome (one chooses to call himself the apex predator), it's back to the camera work that grows with every scene -- from the initial bedroom confessions of teens to the special effects of the big, bad teen act -- cars smashing, window panes being ripped apart, buildings turning into dust.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Matt King (George Clooney) has two problems to deal with: his ancestral virgin property at Hawaii and a dying wife. But before that it’s his two daughters he’s got to play perfect (single) dad to....<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The timing for this one’s India release could not have been more apt: The Descendants made to the list of this year’s Academy Award nominations in three distinct categories -- Best Picture, Best Director (Alexander Payne) and Best Actor (George Clooney) just two days back. For the record, it has already won the Golden Globes for the Best Film and Best Actor category. And here’s why.<br>
<br>
When George Clooney plays single dad to a grown-up irreverent teenage daughter Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) and a little girl Scottie (Amara Miller) who picks up all things wrong from her elder sister, rest assured the dad-daughter equation ought to bring out the uneasiness of a father specially when the daughter is in the backseat of his car with her boyfriend (Will you please not touch each other when I'm around, says Clooney). And when George Clooney realises his wife was in for a blooming affair with Brian Spears right behind his back, he makes it sure to vent out his anger and frustration at his wife even as she lies in coma... just a few minutes away from death (You wanted to divorce me! Well I hated you too, Clooney says in his soliloquy).<br>
<br>
Elizabeth (Patricia) has an almost fatal power boat accident off Waikiki Beach, something that puts her on life support forever. But then her living will wants her off every ventilator. The outcome: The once split family gets together to say their final goodbye. First, it's Alexandra, the rebel daughter, who had issues aplenty with her mom. Next is the husband, Matt King, who never had ample time to perhaps give her what she wanted -- love. Even now that she is dying, he has a multi-million dollar virgin ancestral land deal going for him. Of course, it's his daughters with almost no childhood memories of the place that help him make the right choice. As for Matt King, he helps all around him make the right choice, both as a husband and father. What? One has to follow the protocol of a situation. In this case, all loved ones must get a chance to bid a final adieu to the one on no life support.<br>
<br>
So where exactly does the film score? Three places. First, the irony of its location. On one hand there’s the beautiful Hawaiian landscape, on the other hand is Clooney caught inside the four walls of a hospital room understanding the nuances of parenthood, coping with a dying, unfaithful wife and trying to strike a big corporate deal. In fact, even board meetings in fluorescent Hawaiian shirts do not ease the nerves of the actor. Second is the relationship of a never-been-around dad with a rebel of a teenage daughter and her I'm-so-cool boyfriend. Lastly, it's Clooney himself -- sometimes as the dad who gets all scandalised and worked up each time his daughters swear, sometimes as the restless and helpless, ever questioning husband. Special mention: Watch Clooney convince his wife's boyfriend to make it for one the last time to the hospital and his dying wife.<br>
<br>
Relationships, pain, anger, emotions, understanding, betrayal... all handled with care.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Chris Farraday (Mark Wahlberg) is quite clear about his future plans. He does not want to get back to what he initially did best -- drug smuggling. But little does he know destiny has otherwise in store....<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Mark Wahlberg seems to have mastered the art of the no-nonsense-guns-and barrels guy. Perhaps, that is why, his Chris seems like a cakewalk -- nothing too much and nothing too less. Or so it seems, when it comes to his only calling in life -- family. So much so it eventually takes yet another family member to get him back into action. In this case, it’s his wife Kate’s (Kate Beckinsale) brother, Andy (Caleb Landry Jones) who has just messed up a cocaine delivery project.<br>
<br>
What follows next is the very veteran ex-drugman in question getting into action... and saving many lives (including that of his wife and son) from the bad guy, Tim Briggs (Giovanni Ribisi). But before that there’s a whole lot of the usual Wahlberg-isms -- a complicated network of the bad guys, drugs and drug peddlers, booze, corruption, New Orleans, Panama, hit men, blasts, firing, an intelligent plot to hide all that moolah, a plot gone wrong and the urge to do the job for the one last time. Take your pick.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) works as a government security contractor. Her latest assignment takes her to a whole new world. Not only does she visit locations unknown, but also realises there is no one out there whom she can trust....<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> There aren't many dialogues, but there are many locations: Dublin, Upstate New York, New Mexico, Barcelona.... There aren't many twists and turns, but there are some of Hollywood's bigwigs to watch out for: Michael Fassbender, Ewan McGregor, Channing Tatum.... Now, that’s the first place where you might be in for a little disappointment. How else do you explain the likes of Michael Douglas and his brief cameo, along with Antonio Banderas and a five second stint!<br>
<br>
Mallory Kane is a special contractor for the U.S. government who is cool, calm, composed and even ready to play eye candy as long as you don’t mess with her. Just what her colleagues do. They double cross her to the extent of killing her till she gets to the brain behind it all while she travels from one end of the country to the other. You in the meantime are left craving for the next action sequence (it’s there but after long intervals) in a not-so-happening plot.<br>
<br>
A word about Gina Carano. In real time, she actually ranks No.3 in the United Women's Mixed Martial Arts Ranking. And as an ex martial fighter, she does do justice to the action -- super athletic with great moves, speedy hits, makes it a point to fix the arm while driving and plenty of head banging. But can a stunt woman (high on the adrenaline quotient) in real time make up for the misses (read plot) in reel time?

<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Nothing could perhaps be a more fitting end to the all-time fav Japanese Umizaru series than the very man in question, Daisuke Senzaki, leader of the Japanese Coast Guard, taking on the onus of playing fearless once again simply to save human lives. This time however, the challenge is much bigger. He has got to save all off Regalia -- Japan's largest offshore natural gas rig. Naturally then, much of the screen time sees Hideaki running around saving lives, panicking at times, tasking risks at times, diving into the deep blue ocean and finally coming out the winner. But before that he has yet another tedious task -- to face the bureaucrats who choose that natural gas rig full of natural resources (converting later to moolah unlimited) to human lives.<br>
<br>
So what’s the (last) message? It's pretty loud and clear just like the prequels -- You've got to be clear on what is dearer : That block of natural resources worth crores or human life. Take your pick.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> The boy is getting back to Philadelphia from New York after an all-boyz-and-booze night. The girl is mysterious, putting up all alone in a hotel room. The two strangers end up chatting up with each other for one complete night over the telephone. Something's cooking between strangers?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong>You don't really need a big star cast to send the right message across. Likewise, you don't even need a big budget to the get the techniques of filmmaking bang on. All you need is perhaps a boy (who could be a hopeless case on the romantic front), a girl (who shows she wants nothing when actually she wants it all) and a plain, simple telephone (not cellphone). In fact, you don't even need colour. That's where director Sudhish Kamath's Good Night Good Morning scores the most. Technically, what makes it different is the retro look of the film. Except for the flashbacks and dream sequences, all is in black and white. Add to that the nuances of romance of the good ol’ days. Nostalgic, are we?<br>
<br>
It takes a wild night with alcohol unlimited for Turiya (Manu Narayan) to get that Dutch courage. The courage of course is needed to get back to Moira (Seema Rahmani), the girl he met a few minutes ago at the hotel bar. After the initial phase of rejection, he chooses to gulp down a couple of pegs before calling into the hotel room and chatting her up. So much for a one night stand (ONS). And once connected, the ONS seems to be turning into an affair of a lifetime. You, just like the strangers, actually seem to be hooked on as they share their anecdotes, fears, past, present, future, love life, sex lives, skeletons in their cupboards, ideologies.... In fact, it's their no-strings-attached approach towards each other that gets them closer with each passing second of the night.<br>
<br>
A special mention: Manu Narayan as Turiya does manage to bring out the desperation (and at times restlessness) of a guy on the lookout for a night of fun. Seema comes across as a convincing realist ruled by the practical than fantasy. The two together manage to rake up the battle of sexes with shyness, insecurities and biases as their respective driving force. But then one has got to give it to the dialogue that actually makes the never ending telephone call worth being heard out.<br>
<br>
For the rest, we hope to hear more applause for our Indie film makers more often, specially when they lay claim to a couple of accolades. This one's made it big at the South Asian International Film festival in New York along with the Mumbai Film Festival.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Humans do not want vampires and lycans on Earth. Vampires and werewolves on the other hand want humans out of their way. Enter the vampire warrior, Selene (Kate Beckinsale) who once again leads the battle against mankind.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>2003: The year of Underworld and its gothic touch. 2006: The year of Underworld: Evolution and its high-end drama. 2009: The year of Underworld: Awakening with the promise to be back again. Come 2012 and it’s the year of Underworld Awakening: Vengeance returns. And vengeance there is aplenty this time brought out with more action that you could possibly handle. Picture this: Humans are no longer killing humans; humans are out there to kill vampires and werewolves.<br>
<br>
Selene post her last encounter with humans just has one simple dream: delete Species A (humans) -- something that puts her into prison. Now that she escapes imprisonment, her motive is simple: to search for her (and Michael's) hybrid daughter. What follows next is declaration of martial war to cleanse planet Earth. Just when you wish there was more on the EQ front -- the mother-daughter bond is lost to the war between the humans, vampires and werewolves. But then since when did the Underworld have emotions.<br>
<br>
As for the 3D, the war between the vampires and the werewolves does give you a couple of jolts. Case in point, splashes of water bubbles, discs hovering here and there, rooftop window panes cracking apart. For the rest, leave it to the leather-clad, bloodsucking Kate who, with action unlimited, has ample in store for that extra dose of adrenaline. Just make sure you don't go looking for something too eerie as the earlier versions.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Coriolanus (Ralph Fiennes) is a great Roman soldier. But then he hates two things: his very own people and his sworn enemy, Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler). Now will he use one against the other to get what he actually wants -- power?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Et tu Coriolanus! This no doubt belongs the bard’s lesser known plays category. But then its relevance is as contemporary as it can get -- territorial wars, riots, people’s movement, revolts, protests, scheming, stabbing.... But that’s not the only thing Coriolanus lays claim to. The movie marks the entry of actor Ralph Fiennes into directorial territory.<br>
<br>
Coriolanus (Ralph Fiennes) and Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler) are two sworn enemies in a ‘place called Rome’, till the former in his urge to seek the title of Consul, courtesy his equally power-freak mom Volumnia (Venessa Redgrave), ends up launching a riot in Rome. The citizens revolt and Coriolanus is forced to flee the city to find alliance with Tullus. The bonding factor between the two is of course Mission Destruction (of Rome).<br>
<br>
A word about the performances: If Gerard Butler's Julius is the perfect nemesis of Coriolanus, Vanessa Redgrave comes across as the formidable mom and Brian Cox the ideal political mentor. But then eventually it's back to Ralph's Coriolanus who is just so cold hearted, you actually feel no pity for him even when he is left a loner. But then that's the idea, right?

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> There's a serial killer on the loose. But then this killer is different -- he plans to kill off the police force one by one. Enter detective Sergeant Tom Brant (Jason Statham)....<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> This is the perfect vehicle for Jason Statham to showcase his skills as the bad-ass sociopathic cop who knows only how to kill and lift the testosterone to levels rarely reached with his no nonsense panache for unlettered violence. But Jason isn’t a killer alone. The department loves him because he is a friend in need despite being deprived of all friendly feelings. His I love You, I am there for the team is unconditional. Consider how he tends to his Chief Inspector Roberts cope through his wife’s death and you’ll get the point why he is the most loved and hated cop in the department. Statham, the bad-ass cop is pitted against Barry Weiss (Aiden Gillen) a pessimistic loner with just one purpose in life which is to murder all men in blue. As Tom Brant, Jason once again is seen playing a no-nonsense man of few or no words literally. He, as always, is seen as this hard-nut who drinks a couple of cans and yet manages to walk out of blasts unhurt. Are we complaining? No, for Jason is Jason. The hardships of being a cop aside and the relief Paddy Considine gets to an otherwise action plot as the gay sergeant whom Brant unwillingly accepts, the question remains how much of killing and brutality can one take.<br>
<br>
A lot if Jason is around because you know here is this mean machine that can accomplish anything with chutzpah. Go for Jason Statham’s animalistic charms.

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Alien invasion in the form of bright, yellow floating sparks of energy that decimates its victims to dust? Wow! But the same ball of light -- almost invisible -- but capturing three-quarters of screen time? Not that happening. Specially when the movie tries to send out a strong message to Earthians -- mess not with the energies of the Earth.<br>
<br>
Sean (Emile Hirsch), Ben (Max Minghella), Natalie (Olivia Thirlby) and Anne (Rachael Taylor) are among the few lucky survivors who hide out in a discotheque’s cellar for a few days when Moscow is attacked by alien energy. It's right there that they decide to find their way to the submarine that's taking all the left over survivors to destination unharmed. But what does one do when all is destroyed by the enemy from outer space -- London, New York, Paris, Asia.... What follows next is planning and the innumerable hide and seek moments between the terrified five and the aliens. Sometimes they manage to escape, sometimes it just turns a few into dust.<br>
<br>
But even before you wonder if they will ever make it to the submarine that promises to take them to safer land, there is one bigger question: Why do the electromagnetic enemies never stop messing with all things electric here on Earth? They are there to rob Moscow (read Earth) of its rich minerals we are told....<br>
<br>
As for the 3D, there's ample scope -- the Moscow setup, deserted roads, abandoned cars, man turning into ash, fire everywhere, collapsing buildings and the very aliens as pieces of fireballs -- wasted... in some parts.

Elementary, my dear Holmes?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Lots of problems here Mr. Holmes in your second outing as the flamboyant action hero. But first things first. As a piece of cinema, we do agree of Guy Ritchie's reinvention of the 124 year-old-hero from an cogitating theorising intellectual hero to a daredevil braggadocio. For reinventions are always progressive and take a leap ahead in the history of cinema and fiction. It is only the prude and the fastidious who turn up their nose to any twisting and turning in character and plot.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Retirement is a far-fetched dream for George Smiley (Gary Oldman). Reason? Being a former agent with the British Intelligence Service he is called back to find a mole within the agency. Does Smiley succeed?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> It’s 1970. It’s the Cold War espionage. And it’s based on John Le Carre's 1974 novel. That's not all. Here are some more reasons to watch this one: First, it's a gripping, high profile hunt of a double agent working for the Soviets -- now very much a part of MI6. Second, decoding the intelligence leak and brilliantly short listing the suspects to five men close to him is John Hurt as Control. Yes, John Hurt with those yells does manage to grab eyeballs. Wish he had more screen time, especially amongst too many characters, too many leads, too many secrets, too many codes, too many events and too many suspects. The end result? You actually lose interest in the hunt-for-the-spy game. But again making up for all that is a varied range of performances to choose from.<br>
<br>
If Percy Alleline (Toby Jones) plays the perfect top notch, Bill Haydon (Colin Firth) is utterly at ease despite being one of the prime objects of suspect. Roy Bland (Ciaran Hinds) and Toby Esterhase (David Dencik) are seen as convincing examples of to-trust-or-not-to-trust. But then it’s Gary Oldman’s George Smiley who, after taking it on him to find the mole within the agency, makes up in every which way. Not just in terms of the investigation, but also in the performance department. Watch an irritated, pessimistic and helpless Oldman stuck in never ending boardroom meetings. His mantra: Talk less and observe more if you want to get it right in life even when it comes to the Circus (read the British Intelligence Agency). And we cannot but agree.<br>

To update each other on how different they are ... how different their lives are. But it's only those years of separation that proves how similar they are. Now will the two finally unite on some July 15?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> First when they meet they are on similar ground -- two fresh college grads who bump into one another one sunny morning at the University of Edinburg, get hooked till late night and then decide to call it quits -- no strings attached. Next when they meet -- after a year -- they are poles apart: one a beautiful, hardworking but struggling waitress, the other a cool television production guy who knows how to get the woman on his side. All it takes for the duo -- Emma and Dexter -- to realise that they are still on same ground -- something they call grounded love -- is one single day, July 15.<br>
<br>
But then there are many July 15s in here before Emma and Dexter realise how much they are similar to each other. Just the place we see Anne and Jim go through a hue of emotions -- right from marriage, success, rejection, failure, friendship, confusion, anger.... Just the reason why this one makes for a watch.<br>
<br>
Not to say that's the only reason. Here are some more. First, watch the camera capture the beautiful landscapes of London greens, Edinburg, Paris... as the story shifts from one July to the other. Second, watch it for its adaptation of David Nicholl’s bestseller -- the pages of the book do seem to come to life, though in bits and pieces. But then we are not complaining for what better time to celebrate love than this Christmas weekend.

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> What makes Alvin so adorable? Naturally his rebellious streak and his brash ways which make him stand out as the quintessential rebel. Needless to say, he's always getting into trouble because of his ah-ti-tude. Standing in stark contrast is Simon, the sage, who is a bit too serious for his age.

<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> When Sharon Stone becomes protector of law rest assured crime ought to be nipped in the bud. And when Sharon Stone plays UN superior keeping a tab on crime against humanity with ‘a power to put anyone in prison’, the outcome ought to be strong, powerful and convincing. But what can Stone do alone when a) she hardly has any screen time b) an otherwise promising dark run-and-chase-thriller gets lost in the jungle.<br>

<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The motif is noteworthy -- bringing to light the plight of those that are part of the Lord's Resistance Army. This army base has destroyed thousands of African villages simply to kidnap its local children -- boys are forced to become war soldiers; girls are turned into sex slaves. The setting is perfect -- Sam Childers is a mean guy with a (gun) machine, killing and swearing is his favourite time pass, being a druggie and conman is his means of livelihood, playing daddy and husband for him is no big deal. In short, Sam is everything one ought not to be. So what follows next is an image makeover. But how? He bumps into God and finds his ultimate calling -- to save the Sudanese war soldiers.<br>
<br>
So far so good. But where does this mean-guy-turned-preacher get haywire? Primarily in the fact that there's hardly any focus on his mission -- we barely get to see the Sudanese children struggling to live a life of decency. For the rest, it's all about Childers' gun firing -- yes, there's ample for the action buff in here... or building orphanages, raising money for the needy. In other words, the little African soldiers are never given adequate voice.<br>

Based on a real life character, what really makes up for all in this good-man-versus-evil battle is a short cameo of the real Sam Childers firing shotgun.

In case you get bored with the lack lustre going-ons between one set of people, there's someone else to focus your attention on. That's the advantage of having so many characters....<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> This one's for all those who've actually grown up with the Muppets. For the rest of the tweeny crowd, you can't really blame them. Reason? The Muppets releases after a gap of 12 odd years -- The last one being Muppets from Space released in 1999. And nothing's much changed: Gary still loves Walter. Walter still prefers Gary as his confidant, but then Gary's girlfriend, Mary is someone he finds difficult to convince. They are humans and he's a Muppet after all.<br>
<br>
Ironically even the movie begins with the sorry state of the Muppets in Circa 2011 -- their movies and TV shows are long lost into the past. Even the good 'ol Kermit (the frog of Sesame Street fame) says: “I guess people sort of forgot about us.” The mission then for the three - Gary (Jason Segel), Walter (Peter Linz) and Mary (Amy Adams) -- is to put up a face (read life) saving show worth 10 million dollars. And how?<br>
<br>
First a trip to Hollywood, then plans and shows to raise money. That's where most of the comic elements stem from, especially when the three try to dupe the big bad millionaire Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) who doesn't mind doing away with the Muppet studio for that rich oil well that lies below. But then nothing matches up to the chaos when the Muppets take a little help from human fans out there, who in turn ensure the Muppets -- Fozzie the bear is now part of a local band, Miss Piggy is a fashion editor, Animal is undergoing anger management therapy, Gonzo is a power tycoon – reunite to put up the greatest Muppet show ever.<br>
<br>
And once they do, you know why the Muppets never actually go out of your mind. Watch them belt foot tapping musicals on happiness, togetherness, friendship and the rainbow colours of life. A musical treat all along.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Small town Mississippi girl Skeeter (Emma Stone) wants to become a writer and is on the lookout for a subject of human interest. Only later to realise nothing can grab eyeballs better than interviews and experiences of those belonging to the black community. But then Skeeter gets on to the wrong side of many, specially now that her bestseller is all about shocking revelations by the blacks... in a primarily white society...<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The mission is simple -- Skeeter Phelan is a newly empowered (fresh graduate) white woman in the southern city of Mississippi in the 1960s who wants to write a bestseller. Finding the subject is even simpler -- she chooses to interview the likes of Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis), her best friend's African American help. But then there's a price Skeeter's got to pay for the desired fame and fortune. After all, she's all out to write about the experiences of a domestic help at the homes of the whites. And so the 'cakewalk of a job' soon turns into a not-so-easy-task for the aspiring author -- the whites can't take all that criticism.<br>
<br>
Aibileen has spent most of her life as a nanny, raising little white girls. Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) is a help who is first fired by a social leader and then by a blonde. That leaves the two with enough anecdotes and startling revelations about instances of racism, cruelty and humiliation while on the job. Of course, there are other African American housekeepers out there who bear witness to the everyday crisis of their lives. In fact that's where Skeeter finds the leit motif of a writer -- to use the pen to usher change.<br>
<br>
If Viola Davis's powerful performance as Aibeleen keeps you emotionally engaged in a way you actually start sympathising with her, Octavia Spencer's Minny brings the much needed relief with her sassy comic timing to an otherwise heavy plot -- watch out for the big local charity event. Finally it's Emma Stone's Skeeter who grows with the plot.<br>
<br>
Watch this journey of three extraordinary women who not only build an unlikely friendship, but question the 1960 Mississippi society, fraught with exploitative undertones.
