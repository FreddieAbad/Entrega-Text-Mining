"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>The Fifth Estate traces the story of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange (Cumberbatch) who teams up with Daniel Berg (Brühl) to become international watchdogs. Via WikiLeaks, they expose corruption, lift the lid on corporate crime and shed light on government wrongdoings.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>The slick opening montage of this movie sets the stage for a potentially exciting and gripping story. Assange starts out with nothing, but his silent resolve, coupled with vision, determination and focus, far outreaches his finances. His reputation as a hipster/hacker grows and partnering with Berliner, Berg (a brilliant programmer) is a masterstroke. Together, they make WikiLeaks a force to reckon with.<br>
<br>
As Assange knows that WikiLeaks offers the kind of shocking information that he feels people want to – and probably should – know about, his obsession starts veering towards paranoia. He also has a nose for sensationalism.<br>
<br>
His friendship, followed by a disagreement with Berg is reminiscent of the Zuckerberg-Saverin equation from <em>The Social Network</em>. While that movie brought to light various aspects about human nature, <em>The Fifth Estate</em> doesn’t come close in edginess. You will however, wonder about whether Assange is in it for the greater good, or to feed his own galloping ego. He realizes he has access to information that can make governments quake, and that kind of power can go to anyone’s head.<br>
<br>
Sarah Shaw (Linney) and James Boswell (Tucci) of the US State Department portray their roles well and represent much about the US Government’s perspective on transparency. While the real Julian Assange presently languishes in diplomatic asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, Cumberbatch does a good job of portraying the embattled whistleblower.<br>
<br>
Cumberbatch’s Assange is emotionless, cold and sometimes a bit sinister. For someone who insists on global transparency, his own personality is paradoxically as impervious as a cold steel wall. You wonder what actually is going on inside his head.<br>
<br>
A movie about Assange and WikiLeaks is bound to be tough to tackle and while it has a few things going for it, Condon could have scored better if he chose to focus deeper on Assange’s admittedly complex and mysterious psyche.

<strong>Review:</strong> If <em>Gravity</em> made you experience the horrors of space, this tense drama in the high-seas will leave you feeling claustrophobic.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>Ray Breslin has written the book (literally) on structural security. His job is to pose as a prisoner and then escape from that jail, in order to alert the authorities to its security flaws. The last job he accepts is to break out of an ultra-secure facility, whose location is secret. Once inside, Breslin realizes he must work with fellow inmate Emil Rottmayer in order to escape.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>After a successful breakout from a high-security lockup, Breslin’s business partner Lester Clark (D’Onofrio) then convinces him to accept one last job offered to them by the CIA because of the large payout guaranteed to them. Accordingly, Breslin and work-mates Hush (50 Cent) and Abigail (Ryan) head to a rendezvous point in New Orleans. Things quickly take a different turn.<br>
<br>
Like lumbering man-mountains, Breslin (Stallone) and Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger) harness some serious brain-muscle to go with the testosterone-powered brawn. Håfström (known for his horror flicks) gives each of the main characters clearly-defined attributes. Breslin never loses his cool. Rottmayer is unpredictable. The evil warden Hobbs (Caviezel) looks calm, unflappable and collects butterflies, but you get the feeling that inside, he’s a raving psychopath. Dr Emil Kaikev (Sam Neill) is the prison doctor whose critical sense of conscience injects some much-needed pathos into the proceedings.<br>
<br>
Arnie and Sly are synonymous with action films. Even though both, The Governator and the Italian Stallion are a tad worn around the edges, the two of them serve up some unfussy meat-and-potatoes fare. The script avoids cheesy lines but Schwarzenegger does have some memorable ones, like “You hit like a vegetarian”.<br>
<br>
Their biceps and forearms are as thick as hams, but the ammunition expenditure and fight scenes are scaled back. The pace does, however, go into higher gear during the second half. The characters fit to a tee, except for 50 Cent, incongruously miscast as a computer nerd! The action is routine but the way they plan the escape is interesting and inspired. These guys may be old, but they sure know their chops and can still deal the dice, old-school style.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>Tim (Gleeson) gets clued onto a family secret - all the gents in the house have the ability to travel through time! He then goes about using this power to sort out various wrongs in his life and win over his lady love.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> With a movie title that couldn't possibly be more literal, <em>About Time</em> features an amalgamation of love and philosophy. From the director with a filmography including <em>Notting Hill, Four Weddings</em> <em>and a Funeral,</em> <em>Love Actually</em> and <em>Bridget Jones's Diary, </em>you could safely come to the conclusion that Curtis could spin out another romcom blindfolded. He manages to move beyond flightiness and stops just short of being maudlin or mawkish.<br>
<br>
Tim's dad (Nighy) reveals the time-travelling secret to junior one day. Forget about quantum physics and those lifelong labours of Stephen Hawking and his ilk; apparently, all it takes to time-travel is to close your eyes, clench your fists and focus really hard.<br>
<br>
Not one to waste such a phenomenal gift, Tim is certainly a man with his priorities in order. Forgetting about everything else, he decides to focus on romance in general, Mary (McAdams) in particular, and use his new time-travelling trick to set right certain wrongs.<br>
<br>
Mary is a bit airy. She has her faults but attempts to be endearing. Indeed, Tim and she share an easy chemistry. Gleeson is no Hugh Grant, but McAdams is a highlight in this film. The film is inexplicably long but the genuinely funny jokes that pepper the plot save the film from plodding into a sentimental soup.<br>
<br>
There is a strong idealistic streak running through <em>About Time.</em> After all, which one of us wouldn't want to go back in the years and change certain things? What if we had said the right thing at the right time to him or her...or perhaps avoided that misunderstanding? Wouldn't that relationship have worked out?<br>
<br>
Ultimately, the message is simple and visceral enough to have crossover appeal. Give it a shot if romantic comedies float your boat.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><em><strong>Story</strong>: Dodi Al-Fayed was not the only one. This film is about the love-struck Princess of Wales’ last real-life love affair with a Pakistani heart surgeon.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: Except for getting Princess Diana’s iconic hairdo, outfits and head tilts right, Diana, the biopic fails to recreate the magic of the ‘queen of hearts’. While she was loved for her style, concern for the helpless and unabashed speeches, her personal life invited unwanted media attention. Not one to follow the rulebook, her biopic fails to replicate the massive curiosity and intrigue she evoked during her tumultuous lifetime and death in 1997.<br>
<br>
The film is based on her real-life relationship with a Pakistani heart surgeon, Hasnat Khan (Naveen Andrews), whom she met two years before her death. The lesser known love affair disappoints, since it makes the film look like any other mediocre, run-of-the-mill romantic drama.<br>
<br>
As a result, the immensely talented Naomi Watts too keeps slipping in and out of her larger-than-life character, making it hard for us to remember that we are watching a biopic on Diana in the first place. It’s a pity that of all the Diana stories, the director chose to adapt this one for the big screen.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the story-telling is as dull as the story. Dialogues fall flat. Sluggish pace and predictable confrontations make matters worse. Diana cooks, plays the piano, wears a wig, cleans her beau’s room and does the dishes. This is all you get to see for over two hours. Her interaction and confessions with her acupuncturist would have made for a better story.<br>
<br>
Surprisingly, the royal family members are kept off-screen. William and Harry barely make an appearance. This makes the on-screen Diana look too self-absorbed and detached from her children. Her falling for Hasnat (love at first sight) looks unconvincing and so does her on-off depression. The filmmaker however manages to touch your heart when you see the princess reaching out to the underprivileged.<br>
<br>
If you are fine with seeing Diana as the ‘needy’ woman solely looking for love, living in suffocating secrecy, you may like the film. If you expect to revisit the aura of mystery surrounding her, you will be disappointed.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><em><strong>Story</strong>: A brilliant Princeton math student attempts to rescue his broke bank account by risking all in an online poker game. After he’s cheated of his last cent, he flies to Costa Rica to sort things out with the owner of that gambling website.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: You’ve seen thrillers that are intricate, detailed and unfold at their own pace, allowing the viewer an immersive experience. Runner Runner isn’t quite like that. It’s a breezy film that runs breathlessly from start to finish, pretty much as the movie title suggests it does.<br>
<br>
Richie (Timberlake) is a razor-sharp Poker hand who can’t resist a good deal. He loses everything one night even as his pals watch disbelievingly. When he reaches gambling haven Costa Rica, he meets the über-smooth, louche and nefarious gambling tycoon and villain Ivan (Affleck), who predictably enough, takes Richie under his wing, and throws wads of dollar bills his way every now and then as rewards.<br>
<br>
One of those rewards is also a chance to sleep with his oomphy and curvaceous (even if somewhat vacuous) moll, Rebecca (Arterton), whom Richie begins to lustfully eye almost as soon as he becomes a part of Ivan’s Clicquot-swilling clique.<br>
<br>
So swayed is Richie that it takes a sudden intervention from FBI Agent Shavers (Mackie) to forcefully let Richie know about the rot in Ivan’s Caribbean Empire of Sin. Soon, Richie gets to know what the old adage ‘never trust a gambler’ means.<br>
<br>
Affleck is at ease in his role and has some good lines. It’s pretty apparent that Timberlake channels more than a few stylistic touches and mannerisms from some of his recent roles. Early on in the movie, Furman shifts focus from Poker to something else. Arterton’s Rebecca seems comfortable with being the eye-candy and is every part the bombshell, a much-needed counterpoint in this casino boogie of a movie, otherwise full of tumbling dice and dirty deals in broad daylight.<br>
<br>
A promising plot like this could have offered you a full course, yet what you’re served is diet fare at best.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> S<em>et in 2154, the film gives us a grim view of the future, where the poor live on an over-populated, ruined earth, the rich on a luxurious</em> <em>space station. Can one man bring about a change?</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Mutants, superheroes, aliens, gadgets...while Hollywood fancies fiction that's more escapist, Neill Blomkamp, in his inimitable style, gives us a dark science fiction thriller that's relevant to present-day society and existing social and economic inequality.<br>
<br>
Blomkamp's splendid vision merges facts and fiction to give us a grim view of the future (the year is 2154), when earth is over-populated and ruined. The gap between rich and poor couldn't be more evident. With crime and the disease rate on a high, the planet is no longer fit for human habitation. The rich relocate to a man-made space station 'Elysium', which exclusively offers them luxury and high-tech medical facilities.<br>
<br>
In order to preserve their lifestyle, immortality and longevity, they ensure that the poor gain no access to Elysium. Max (Matt Damon), an ordinary factory worker, gets exposed to a severe dose of radiation that can only be cured on Elysium. He has five days to live. Can he get there?<br>
<br>
No matter how gripping, Elysium is no match for Blomkamp's hard-hitting 'District 9'. Scenes of the protagonist Max running around, trying to get help from the thugs featured here, become repetitive. The villains (Jodie Foster as Elysium's cold and conniving protector and Sharlto Copley as a sleeper agent) are one-dimensional.<br>
<br>
However, what works in the film's favour is the director's satirical intent. There's a scene where a factory owner asks his employee to cover his mouth while talking. Fearing he might catch an infection, he orders, 'Don't breathe on me.' It's this acute portrayal of the mindset of the 'heartless rich' that grips you.<br>
<br>
The premise is thought-provoking with the whole 'degradation of human life' theme deeply affecting your psyche. Aerial shots of over-populated earth might even remind you of Mumbai.<br>
<br>
<em>Elysium</em> is like a warning of a disturbing future that we can all see coming.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>A frustrated English art curator Harry Deane (Firth) tries to get one up over his boss by conning him into buying a fake painting worth millions. As part of the ruse, Harry enlists the help of his assistant and a feisty Texan lady.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>While billed as a remake of a 1966 movie starring Michael Caine and Shirley MacLaine, this film seems a very distant, though modern facsimile of the former. Life is difficult for Harry because his boss, a millionaire mogul called Lionel Shabandar (Rickman, sharp as ever), tends to make his bumbling minion feel like an idiot. What Harry does know a lot about, however, is art. He can tell a Rembrandt from a Monet with just a glance and a very good fake from the real McCoy.<br>
<br>
Deciding to con his boss, Harry isolates Monet's 'Haystacks' (thought to be lost in the aftermath of Nazi-occupied Europe in World War II) and enlists his trusty assistant, The Major (Courtenay) to forge a copy of the same. As part of the ruse, Texan cowgirl P.J. (Diaz), in whose grandma's (Leachman) house the fake Monet hangs, is flown down to England to meet, charm and seal the deal with Shabandar for the rare canvas.<br>
<br>
P.J. seems to embody almost every aspect of a Texan parody available. But enough is telegraphed in a film of this sort, and things can and will unravel. As Shabandar and P.J. develop their own chemistry, Harry's plan seems to fizzle. And what Harry doesn't know is that as a final insulting coup de grâce, Shabandar plans to fire him and replace him with German art appraiser Zaidenweber (Tucci).<br>
<br>
Rickman and Firth fit their roles like a glove while Diaz with the Texan chic, yee-hawing in Central London, is a bit silly. However, Hoffman uses London as a backdrop rather nicely. And the Coen Brothers' (screenplay) stamp is more than evident. This is a fairly standard heist comedy, but is loaded with just enough silly humour and charm to make it a pleasant ride.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>The Dover and Birch families meet for a Thanksgiving dinner, after which their six-year-old daughters Anna and Joy go for a walk. They don't return. The occupant of a van parked outside is the immediate suspect. Keller Dover (Jackman) then embarks on his own manic search for the girls.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Keller is a religious man whose motto is to 'be prepared'. Accordingly, his basement is stocked up for an apocalypse and the lines on his face show that he's known struggle all his life. Alex Jones (Dano) is the occupant of the dilapidated van parked outside their home and after the girls go missing, Keller's gut instinct that Alex is behind the abduction turns him into a man obsessed with breaking Alex.<br>
<br>
Investigating the case, Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) is tattooed, brooding, speaks little but is firm. His only sign of emotion is a nervous facial tic. He has never lost a case before but this one tests his mettle to breaking point. His performance builds with quiet intensity. After a round of questioning, Alex, who seems to have the cognitive ability of a small child, is released. Nancy and Franklin Birch (Davis, Howard) believe in Loki's efforts but are mired in grief. As the search goes on and hope begins to dim, Keller descends into his own heart of darkness and his wife Grace (Bello) slips into a sedative haze.<br>
<br>
The violence isn't glamourised, but looks as real as possible and therefore, sometimes disturbing. Most visual cues are suggested, but are never overt. Villeneuve's meticulous vision and cinematographer Roger Deakins' lustrous palette of greys, blacks and overcast skies set up an ominous mood, aided superbly by Jóhann Jóhannsson's music.<br>
<br>
A film with many emotional components, the visceral panic, desperation and helplessness any parent would feel when their children are abducted, forms its bedrock. Each watershed point takes its own time to build. This ensures that you will want to pay attention to the details that makes <em>Prisoners</em> so enjoyable.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>Rush chronicles the famous rivalry between Formula One’s two fiercely competitive drivers, James Hunt and Niki Lauda, during the 1976 season. Lauda’s near-fatal crash and relationship with Hunt forms the story.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>It’s easy to glamourise a film based on Formula One racing, given the nature of the sport – extreme speed, adrenaline rush, roaring engines, champagne, hot Pit girls, playboy racers and sexy F1 cars. On the other hand, it’s also convenient to deglamourise a ‘sports biopic’ by giving it a documentary treatment.<br>
<br>
Ron Howard doesn’t succumb to either. His splendid execution strikes the right balance to give us a film that is visually stunning, moving, nail-bitingly intense and heroically entertaining, just like a Formula One Grand Prix.<br>
<br>
While the sport is much safer today than it was in the '70’s, what has stayed constant is the rivalry between drivers. So was the case with the notorious British playboy racer James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and his brilliant, methodical Austrian opponent Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl). The film revolves around their contrasting ideologies and their battle for the 1976 world championship. Their passion for victory pushes them to breaking point.<br>
<br>
You get to witness the tumultuous lives of these drivers, on and off the track. Also, the film doesn’t merely state facts in an episodic manner. The story-telling lends depth to the characters, leaving you emotionally invested in them. You feel their fear, regrets, insecurities and vulnerability.<br>
<br>
What adds to the film’s brilliance is its astounding cinematography, be it the wheel-to-wheel, rain-soaked racing or crash scenes. Performances are supremely authentic as well. Both Hemsworth and Brühl play their parts with utmost perfection. Background score creates the psychological tension required.<br>
<br>
If you are a F1 fan, you must know that <em>Rush</em> starts from the pole position, maintains its momentum and makes it to the chequered flag for a grand podium finish. Long after it’s over, you don’t think about death, danger, victory or rivalry. You remember two champions who didn’t race for a living but lived because they loved racing.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><em><strong>Story</strong>: Former Mafia boss Giovanni Manzoni (De Niro) and family are relocated to a nondescript town in Normandy as part of an FBI Witness Protection Program. With their changed identities and a new life, will they be able to adapt and keep the past from catching up.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: There’s a code, the Omertà included, that you’ll find critical to most Mafia films - loyalty, keeping your friends close, your enemies closer and so on. But there’s also that bit about not bringing matters about the mean streets home to discuss at the dinner table. Meaning, keeping ‘work’ and home as separate entities. However, the Manzoni family has everyone in on the violence. The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree and Giovanni and Maggie’s (Pfeiffer) kids Belle (Agron) and Warren (D’Leo) inherit their dad’s habit for mafioso-grade violence.<br>
<br>
Across the Atlantic from their native Brooklyn, they could very well be on another planet. Maggie finds the French obsession with cream as a cooking ingredient distasteful and Giovanni (renamed ‘Fred’ by the Feds) finds his French neighbours too prying and full of Continental arrogance.<br>
<br>
The comedy, however, ends here and matters become serious. The local priest shuns Maggie from the Church after she confesses their past, Fred soon starts killing and breaking the bones of anyone who gives him a hard time and Warren is expelled from school after charges of corruption, smuggling and drugs pile up; in essence, a mini Mafia.<br>
<br>
And their past, like the proverbial wolf that’s always at the door, is never too far behind despite the grave and unsmiling Agent Stansfield’s (Tommy Lee Jones, whose face looks craggier than a mountainside) best attempts to keep their cover from blowing.<br>
<br>
It’s a little-known fact that Pfeiffer had failed the audition to star opposite De Niro in Martin Scorsese’s Raging Bull. She’s managed it after 30 years and for a movie as good as this, it was totally worth it.<br>

Now forced to work together and abandoned by their agencies, will they escape the resulting mess with their heads intact?</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>There have been all manner of buddy-cop films over the years, with various motifs. <em>Colors</em> had a rookie cop with a seasoned LAPD officer, <em>Rush Hour </em>saw the Orient paired with the Occident, <em>Tango & Cash</em> saw a suave cop with a ragged partner, <em>K-9 </em>even had a cop teamed up with a dog while <em>Starsky & Hutch</em> had two goofballs. <em>2 Guns </em>couldn't be a more literal title - Marcus 'Stig' Stigman (Wahlberg) packs a 9mm automatic and Robert 'Bobby' Trench (Washington) slings a .44 magnum.<br>
<br>
The action unfolds along the US-Mexico border where the two attempt to set up drug lord Papi Greco (Olmos) by going under the radar. They rob a bank and are almost successful, but are shocked to find that the paper trail leads to some dead-ends. And while they were once the pursuers, Trench and Stigman find out that they're now the pursued.<br>
<br>
The plot gets a bit more complex from here, as you wonder whether the camaraderie they share will fall apart. As events unfold, they realize they have been double-crossed by the very people they least expected it from. Trench and Washington have their rivalry and are wary of each other but bear a healthy respect for the other in a tight spot. And bickering aside, when push comes to shove, they could count on each having the other's back.<br>
<br>
What sets this film apart from standard buddy-cop fare is that the enemy is in their midst and not some larger-than-life despot demanding a ransom the size of a small country's GDP. Earl (Paxton) is convincing as a villain. And Wahlberg's swagger is impressive, as is the movie.<br>

<strong>Review</strong>: Lenny (Sandler) has given up his job and along with his wife Roxanne (Hayek) and kids, moves back to his hometown. You get a taste of what's in store for the rest of the movie with a cascade of inexplicable events that unfold. Take, for example, when Lenny and Roxanne wake up and find, for no reason whatsoever, a deer in their bedroom, munching on Roxanne's sexy lingerie. There follows a long sequence of how they manage to get the deer out of their house.<br>
<br>
Cut to pal Kurt (Rock) and wife Deanne (Rudolph) for a nonsensical breakfast scene. Higgins (Spade) has a visit from a son he didn't know he had while Eric (James), well, he's just busy trying to perfect the art of burping, sneezing and passing wind at the same time - a technique he calls 'burpsharting'. From here, the movie seems largely improvised, like the scene where the wives bump and grind with gratuitous cleavage shots for a very unconventional aerobics class. Or, the time they haul Eric to a lake for a swimming session, stumble on to a college party and are ragged. In this scene, Taylor Lautner steals the show.<br>
<br>
Apart from family values and sticking by your friends, scriptwriters Sandler, Herlihy and Wolf speak about a healthy appreciation for the curvaceous female form. You're not going to watch this film looking for finesse.<br>
<br>
There are Sandler movies with far better laughs. In fact, it's a little hard to describe this film as anything more than a bunch of grown men acting like dorks and in the process, attempting to wrangle a few gags out of situations that seem like a home video stretched to feature film length. The only thought that this film might provoke is to make you wonder what Sandler and gang were thinking when they made this.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>A chronicle about life both on and off the road of the biggest boy band around today, this documentary combines concert footage with the stories of One Direction's rise to fame</em>.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>The idea behind this film follows a now-familiar trend. A group tastes almost instant success, the money rolls in and a little while later comes a movie for the fans to lap up while the band's still hot.<br>
<br>
Only this time, it's a bit odd that Morgan Spurlock (of <em>Supersize</em><em> Me</em> fame), who has a reputation for his critical views about various aspects of popular culture, was roped in to document this saccharine-sweet group's super-sized success.<br>
<br>
One Direction (put together by Simon Cowell) is probably the only group that was buoyed to fame thanks to their Twitter following. While they aren't exceptional dancers or song-writers, what they can do quite well is to harmonize nicely with each other's voices. While the behind-the-scenes footage gives fans a window into their off-stage personalities, their banter about the nature of fame is lengthy and the film does not devote enough time to their singing prowess, which is what they're best at.<br>
<br>
Although they are shown performing in stadiums (most of their hits, including What Makes You Beautiful and Live While We're Young) from Tokyo to Mexico City, the film focuses on the peripherals such as the joking around, interspersed with sentimental situations, like Zayn buying his parents a new home and getting teary-eyed. They visit their old employers and appear - at least on camera - not to take their success too seriously. The next step would be for Spurlock to place halos above their heads.<br>
<br>
Zayn, Niall, Liam, Harry and Louis are talented guys no doubt and so, the film had potential. Spurlock could have painted a truly gripping, well-rounded picture of a band touring exhaustively - the good along with the temper flares, egos, insecurities that make them human rather than showing them as saints.<br>
<br>
What we get instead is just another staged performance.

<strong>Review: </strong>The film captures exploits of Riddick (Vin Diesel), after he is deceived and left for dead on an obscure planet full of alien predators. All he knows about his existence is the fact that he’s not on Furya. To add to his woes, he is also being chased by bounty hunters, who want him dead. The tough guy’s fight for survival forms the story.<br>
<br>
Do the antics of a lone Riddick marooned on a hostile planet manage to hold your interest? It does to a certain extent, especially in the opening scenes, where you see Riddick playing a deadly hide-and-seek with the murderous creatures. However, eventually, the storyline ends up free-floating as if lost in space, just like its lead character. After a while, the killings and order of events start looking monotonous, making the film seem more of a low-budget slasher movie than a sci-fi thriller.<br>
<br>
Those who like horror might like the gore – chopping of heads and bodies but the profanities hurled at women, homosexuals are a bit unsettling, even given the context and genre of the film.<br>
<br>
<em>Riddick</em> solely relies on the bald & beefy Diesel’s macho appearance and deep-raspy voice. No effort has gone into penning a substantial screenplay or making the visual effects look better. Dark visuals of barren, lifeless planet fail to create the desired impact. Nothing really instills fear.<br>
<br>
We wonder if even fans of the franchise, had high expectations from this sequel, given the mediocrity of the previous film (<em>The Chronicles of </em><em>Riddick</em>). Everything about the film looks as artificial as the glowing-eyes of its central character, barring the cool bikes.<br>

Overall, Riddick fails to engage you.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>Poseidon's son Percy sets off with his friends to retrieve the Golden Fleece - the only thing that can save their world from destruction. But along their way, they must face many obstacles.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>At the utopian fun-house otherwise known as Camp Half-Blood, life for Percy Jackson (Lerman) and his ilk is groovy. But he gets a not-so-welcome surprise one day when introduced to his half-brother Tyson (Douglas Smith). To add to his shock (but not awe), Tyson is a cyclops! Soon enough, their idyll is shattered when they are attacked by what can be best described as a rampaging, mechanical bull. The bull manages to breach their shield. The shield was supported by a magical tree created by Zeus when his daughter Thalia Grace (Kwiatkowski), who met her maker after a bloody battle went wrong, was poisoned.<br>
<br>
After the bull is turned to scrap metal, the perpetrator is found to be Luke Castellan (Abel), a rather angry young lad sporting a sulky expression like a kid does when denied his dinner. Luke, for no particular reason, wants to turn Mount Olympus into rubble. But the flaxen haired Annabeth Chase (Alexandra Daddario) keeps having brainwaves throughout the film. When she isn't having brainwaves, she seems to love to hug Percy, presumably to boost his confidence levels and harden his resolve, which often wanes.<br>
<br>
She realizes that only the Golden Fleece can restore the tree to health and in doing so, save all of them too. But the camp's boozy director, aptly named Dionysus (Tucci), sends the God of War's daughter, the impossibly bitchy Clarisse La Rue (Leven Rambin), to find it instead. Not to be outdone, Percy gathers his gang - Annabeth, Tyson and Grover Underwood (Jackson) - to locate the Golden Fleece on his own.<br>

The best thing about this predictable film is undoubtedly the special effects. For want of anything better, <em>Sea of Monsters</em> is a mishmash of various similar films in this genre and a passable potpourri of Greek mythology retold with a contemporary veneer.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>The film follows Clary (Lily Collins), a young girl who discovers that she actually belongs to the clan of shadowhunters, angelic warriors who kill demons. Can she protect the world from evil forces?</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Clary's primary agenda, however, is to search for her missing mother. While doing so, she is constantly shielded by a fellow shadowhunter Lace (Jamie Campbell Bower), who needs her for a mission of his own. While Clary finds the flirtatious Lace's expertise at combat and insensitivity attractive, it's her best friend Simon (Robert Sheehan) who secretly harbours feelings for her. Who gets Clary and the reason behind her mother's disappearance form the plot.<br>
<br>
<em>Twilight </em>became a tween sensation and <em>The Mortal Instruments </em>follows in its footsteps. The film is the first part of a formulaic fantasy series, strictly catering to younger audiences. Also based on a book, set in modern times, MI draws heavily from the <em>Twilight </em>franchise as it too centers around a young girl, non-human characters (vampires/werevolves) and a love triangle.<br>
<br>
While the latter has better action in terms of canvas and execution, <em>Twilight </em>scores higher when it comes to romance. We must say MI has a better protagonist than <em>Twilight</em>, as much to our relief, Clary isn't self-destructive like Bella.<br>
<br>
On the flip side, while MI has all the right ingredients to appeal to a young crowd, including smart one-liners, the story-telling is highly unimaginative. There is no tension between characters, nor is the conflict between them sufficiently established. The negative characters seem way too ordinary to make an impact and after a while, the chase seems tedious.<br>
<br>
It's the fight scenes that lift the film above mediocre, followed by the presence of Brit actor Jamie Campbell Bower. The former model has the looks, attitude and charisma to compete with heart-throb Robert Pattinson, aka Edward Cullen, and make teen girls go weak in the knees.<br>
<br>
If you fancy action-fantasies like <em>Underworld, Twilight, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters,</em> you might like this one.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>Can a small-time drug dealer manage to smuggle an enormous supply of marijuana into the US from Mexico with the help of a fake wife and two pretend kids?</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Small-time drug dealer David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) must cross the US-Mexico border to smuggle a major drug consignment, clear debts and make things right with drug lord Brad (Ed Helms). David comes up with a plan to fulfill his dangerous mission.<br>
<br>
To appear harmless, he pretends to be part of a happy American family on vacation to Mexico. He hires Rose, the stripper (Jennifer Aniston), to be his wife and two teenagers (Will Poulter, Emma Roberts) to be his children. Can the fake family pull off the unfamiliar task?<br>
<br>
If outrageous, politically incorrect, sleazy or, to be specific, 'genital jokes' offend you, <em>We're the Millers </em>may not amuse you. However, if you are not a holier-than-thou type and find plenty of adult humour hilarious, there's enough madness in the film to keep you entertained.<br>
<br>
In spite of a predictable story (we all know the fake family will end up functioning as a real family eventually), what makes the movie work is the spectacular comic timing and performances of the lead actors. They lend just the right amount of chutzpah to their bizarre roles. The madcap characters don't get mushy at the drop of a hat which is hugely refreshing. What also clicks is the balance the story manages to maintain between heart- warming emotions and dirtiness.<br>
<br>
Jennifer Aniston shuttles between motherly and sultry with utmost ease. Men are bound to drool over her in an elaborate stripping scene. Jason Sudeikis gets his rude act right. Will Poulter is adorable as the 'virgin' nice boy while Emma Roberts blends in perfectly as the wild child.<br>
<br>
<em>We're the Millers</em> is a predictable but funny road trip movie that's loaded with sexual expletives. In spite of the occasional silliness, it does make you laugh.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>Cindy Paulson (Hudgens) manages a lucky escape from the clutches of serial killer Robert Hansen (Cusack) and becomes key witness in the case to convict him.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Robert Hansen may not have the kind of recall value as other serial killers do, but his handiwork is no less terrible. Currently serving 461 years in prison, Hansen would kidnap, repeatedly rape and then brutally shoot his victims (numbering 17 to 21) after releasing them in the wilds of Alaska in the early '80s.<br>
<br>
In this true story, a police officer responds to a distress call from a motel one night and finds an almost hysterical Cindy cowering in a bathroom, handcuffed and bleeding. She is questioned but DA Pat Clives (Kurt Fuller) later trashes the theory that Hansen’s a suspect.<br>
<br>
Her story then reaches State Trooper Jack Halcombe (Cage), whose gut instinct tells him Hansen intended Cindy to be his latest victim. Jack’s wife Allie (Mitchell) plays the stereotypical cop’s wife, who’s more bothered about whether her husband bought the groceries.<br>
<br>
Following his instincts, Jack takes Cindy under his wing and along with Sgt. Lyle Haugsven (Norris) carefully connects the dots to get the killer. Jack has to protect Cindy no matter what but nabbing Hansen isn’t easy. He has the perfect alibi – the façade of an all-American life with a loving wife, kids and a flourishing bakery business.<br>
<br>
Hudgens makes you empathize with her character; her performance is surprisingly remarkable. The location (Alaska) lends a lot to the film’s tone. The close-ups are stark, yet emotive. Walker eschews creative licence in favour of keeping the true story in taut focus. Lorne Balfi’s score enhances the visuals. The film does navigate through familiar serial killer-thriller checkpoints but the screenplay does pack in some clever tricks. Scott Walker does not sensationalize Cusack’s Hansen and Cage thankfully reins in his histrionics.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>The film traces Steve Jobs' meteoric rise from a Northern California hippie to the co-founder of Apple Inc, one of the most iconic innovators of our times.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>The opening scene is riveting. The year is 2001. Clad in his famous black turtleneck and blue jeans uniform, you see Jobs (Ashton Kutcher) introducing an Ipod in a staff meeting. Soon after, flashbacks follow and you are transported to his early life at college, visit to India and how he brought about the personal computer revolution.<br>
<br>
To make a biopic on Steve Jobs (the man revered across the world for revolutionising technology) with Ashton Kutcher (former model who has Punk'd celebs, acted goofy in most films) playing the lead was always a tough one to pull off. While Ashton may not be in the league of Hollywood's celebrated method actors, much to our surprise, he not only resembles Jobs but is competent and sincere in his attempt at portraying the ground-breaking entrepreneur. It's the forgettable background score, unimaginative story-telling and a dreary screenplay that makes the film look tedious.<br>
<br>
While it's unfair to expect the filmmaker to include almost every aspect of Jobs' turbulent life in his 120-minute feature film, we wish he'd have invested more in offering us a deeper insight into the man behind Apple and his associates. Instead, we are made to skim through Jobs' work history in an episodic manner with disjointed scenes that fail to arouse emotion.<br>
<br>
The film draws a lot from <em>The Social Network</em>, especially when it comes to portraying Jobs as the 'flawed human being', equation with board members or fallout with friends. What worked for the Facebook film however was Aaron Sorkin's solid screenplay. It all moves at a sluggish pace here, making the plot seem ambiguous.<br>
<br>
Jobs also goes on to state the obvious, which exposes the fact that a little more research was required. We already know about Jobs' passion for innovation, habit of randomly firing employees or how it's always lonely at the top. His rivalry with Bill Gates is mentioned way too casually, while the rest, personal life, marriage, Pixar, health issues, management mottos, the launch of Iphone, are all left out.<br>
<br>
<em>Jobs</em> is an ambitious but an incomplete effort. It's 'not bad' but that's certainly not what Steve Jobs stood for.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:<em> </em></strong><em>Can a tiny crop-dusting plane with a fear of heights fly beyond its limits and challenge racing aircrafts to win an around-the-world aerial race?</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Set in the world of cars, Disney's latest film is about cute planes with adorable big eyes and diverse accents, who race each other to win the Wings Across the World race. Dusty Crophopper (Dane Cook), a little crop-dusting plane with a big heart and bigger dreams, enters the competition, in spite of fearing heights and lacking strength. He trains under a former navy fighter jet Skipper (Stacy Keach) for the competition. Does he win?<br>
<br>
Made on a modest budget, <em>Planes</em> is about conquering your fears, pushing your limits and believing in the beauty of your dreams. It's the classic <em>David and Goliath</em> tale, where you bring home the message that 'It's nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice'. Through its central character, the film also tries to defy the adage 'good guys finish last'. While you are expected to cheer for Dusty, the underdog, what entertains you more is the flirting that goes on between Spanish (Carlos Alazraqui) and a Canadian plane.<br>
<br>
While the film is loaded with typically sweet Disney moments, what makes it forgettable is the formulaic story-telling, predictable climax and a familiar plot that fails to keep you hooked emotionally. It's strictly made for younger kids. Also, do keep your expectations in check, for it's not a PIXAR film. The 3D doesn't add much to the movie-viewing experience.<br>
<br>
The major attraction of the film is Bollywood actress Priyanka Chopra's voiceover debut in a Hollywood production. The actress impresses as she lends her seductive voice to an Indian plane, Ishani. Her accent does not sound too Indian though. Like it happens in most Hollywood films, the sitar starts playing every time she appears. One gets to hear T<em>ere</em><em> Bina -</em> AR Rahman's composition from <em>Guru</em> for a brief moment too.<br>
<br>
<em>Planes </em>has its share of fun moments but is underwhelming, especially when compared to the kind of animation films that are being made today.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>Can anyone become a superhero? It certainly seems so! Here, Kick-Ass teams up with other vigilantes to form the crime-fighting Justice Forever clan.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Jeff Wadlow's follow-up to Matthew Vaughn's <em>Kick-Ass</em> (2010) attempts to penetrate deeper into the contrast between the wish-fulfillment of ordinary people living out their fantasy versus living a 'regular' life. You have an almost surreal situation where ordinary folks wearing clown-like (pyjamas included) costumes dish out the kind of gore that looks quite nasty.<br>
<br>
High-schooler Dave (Taylor-Johnson, alter-ego Kick-Ass) tries to convince Mindy (Chloë, playing Hit Girl) to train him. But she has her own issues -an over-protective dad, an identity crisis and fellow students who try to erode her self-esteem. Dave (often parodying Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker) is turned down by her. Not to be outdone, he finds himself a new team comprising Colonel Stars and Stripes (Carrey), Night Bitch (Lindy Booth), Dr. Gravity (Faison), Ass Kicker (Augustus Prew) and Battle Guy (Clark Duke).<br>
<br>
The bad guy, Chris (Mintz-Plasse) blames Kick-Ass for his father's death, emerges in a new avatar called The Mother f**ker (the costume being his dead mom's S&M outfit and sex toys), recruits a bunch of 'heavy hitters' and seeks revenge. In one violent sequence, the ripped Mother Russia (Olga Kurkulina) feels the rage and shreds a bunch of cops using a powered lawnmower. Another involves Hit Girl paying cheeky homage to <em>Kill Bill Vol 1</em>'s Yakuza battle scene.<br>
<br>
Politically incorrect dialogues aside, <em>Kick-Ass 2</em> is actually quite a fun ride. Beneath the deliberately ridiculous costumes and mock-serious dialogues lies a sea of brutality and gore gleefully topped off with the kind of language that would make a sailor blush. But violence aside, there's also the message about the real hero being the person behind the costume and not the accoutrements. Moretz gives a strong performance. All said and done, this movie definitely kicks ass.<br>

<strong>Review: </strong>About half an hour into <em>R.I.P.D</em>, its ingredients become apparent: Take one part <em>Ghostbusters</em>, throw in a helping of <em>Men In Black</em>, some <em>Van Helsing</em>, add a buddy-cop garnish and what you get is gloop instead of stew.<br>
<br>
Nick (Reynolds) and his cop partner Hayes (Bacon) find themselves in a shootout in a tough part of town. Bad cop Hayes fills Nick full of hot lead, and the latter is sucked into a vortex in the sky (not quite a stairway to heaven, this!) to land up in the office of Proctor (Parker) who helms the Rest in Peace Department.<br>
<br>
She makes him an offer, telling Nick that their job of capturing spirits is critical because too many of them loitering around on Earth can cause some kind of cosmic imbalance that can prove cataclysmic for humankind. The briefing done, Nick is introduced to his new partner, Roy (Bridges) who grudgingly accepts him. Along the way, they learn about a plot that could lead to Earth's destruction.<br>
<br>
There are some fun bits - when the two walk amongst the living, they are visible to humans as an 'avatar'. Roy appears to people as a hot blonde and Nick, an old Oriental dude. An incongruous pairing from which more gags could easily have been extracted.<br>
<br>
Ryan's expressions oscillate between angry, incredulous and gobsmacked; it's as if he's wondering what the hell he's doing in such an inert, roughly-scripted movie. Bridges, resembling a gun-slinging Colonel Sanders with a bigger moustache, is his gruff, comic self. His gags save the movie from utter dullsville. On the whole, despite some zippy camera work and the occasional time-slice photography, it's surprising how plain this big budget ($130 million) film looks. By and large, grossly underwhelming for a movie that could have delivered so much more.

While Smurfette soon finds herself suffering from a bit of a crisis herself, it's up to the rest of the Smurfs to rescue her, foil Gargamel's plot and save the day.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: While the initial <em>Smurfs</em> flick was set in New York, this one takes a continental turn and shifts the scene to Paris, where the irrepressible Gargamel (a very eager Hank Azaria) needs something called 'Smurf Essence', which he uses as part of his magician's act. So, he sends out one of his Naughties called Vexy (Christina Ricci) to kidnap Smurfette (Katy Perry, who fits the role pretty nicely) via an inter-dimensional portal he has opened. He believes that Smurfette is a key ingredient in his quest for world domination. The fact that Smurfette is herself feeling a little blue, so to speak, because the whole village has forgotten her birthday (or so she thinks) doesn't help matters.<br>
<br>
The pursuit begins with Papa Smurf (Jonathan Winters), Clumsy (Anton Yelchin), Grouchy (George Lopez) and Vanity (John Oliver) in hot pursuit. Papa Smurf, the voice of wisdom, uses magical crystals to port into the real world to enlist the help of Patrick Winslow (Neil Patrick Harris) and his stepfather Victor Doyle (Brendan Gleeson).<br>
<br>
The pace, along with the live action, keeps moving and the script has several witty asides. In an attempt to appeal to a wider audience, there are a few sub-plots too, among them a moralistic take on who really created Smurfette. The rest of the Smurfs also get their 15 minutes of fame and gags. Apart from that, the film's score (Heitor Pereira) adds a non-verbal emotiveness to some of the scenes. Also livening things up a bit is the comic timing in the movie.<br>
<br>
All said and done however, while there is nothing disagreeable about this movie, there's nothing very remarkable about it either.

A coming-of age tale, the journey teaches Kai some important lessons in life.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> So far this year, we've seen animated films about all kinds of creatures -racing snails, furry monsters, midget forest dwellers and various other cute creatures. So it's only fitting that there should be one about birds, as is the case with Zambezia.<br>
<br>
Kai (Jeremy Suarez) is an ambitious and impetuous falcon who dreams of life beyond his current abode. Opportunity lands at his doorstep when Gogo (Jenifer Lewis) enchants him with tales about an exotic-sounding city called Zambezia. Now, apart from being enamoured by female falcon Zoe (Abigail Breslin) who also provides him inspiration, Kai is in conflict with his dad Tendai (Samuel L. Jackson) about the whole Zambezia idea.<br>
<br>
Zoe's father is the wise elder of Zambezia called Sekhuru (Leonard Nimoy) who also offers the young Kai wise words. This is when things take a familiar turn - as part of his coming of age, he must overcome the parent-child conflict and stick with his beliefs. There's also another reason why Kai wants to go to Zambezia - to join the Hurricanes, who comprise the city's guardian elite. To make the grade, he must please the leader of the Hurricanes, Ajax (Jeff Goldblum). Together, they must be vigilant of the Marabous (who are not allowed in the city) who have teamed up with a dangerous lizard called Buzdo (Jim Cummings).<br>
<br>
The plot of this South African film is needlessly complicated and the dialogues, too many. The surfeit of characters clutters the film and makes the pace plod at times, despite the relatively short running time. The animations look quite dull and not smooth enough, like a dated video game. This one's fairly ho-hum.

Each morning, one hapless snail gets gobbled up by a wily crow. Theo, who idolizes a French race driver called Guy Gagné (Bill Hader), dreams of being able to race someday.<br>

Chet thinks Theo's speedy dreams will come to naught. Then one day, Theo gets sucked into a race car's engine air intake, is infused with a fuel additive and emerges with a superpower. He is now Turbo, who can zip along at insane speeds.<br>
<br>
Later, an encounter with a hungry crow lands Chet and Turbo in the city, where they get picked up by Tito (Peña) who helps his taco-making older brother Angelo (Guzman) run their food stall. Tito also bets on snail races and is overjoyed to discover Turbo's gift. It's not long before they get Turbo all geared up, so to speak, for the Indy 500.<br>
<br>
Some of the scenes are a bit 'out there', in a manner of speaking. It's almost like the writers had ingested something before coming up with some scenarios. Where else would you see a sequence where a group of snails (one called Smoove Move, voiced by Snoop Dogg and another named Burn, with Maya Rudolph's voice) surf on overhead power cables to House of Pain's 'Jump Around' pumping in the background? Or the very premise of the story - that of a snail that's faster than a racing car? But the good thing is that the film delights in its absurdity.<br>
<br>
Although this movie is no <em>Toy Story</em> or <em>Shrek</em>, it is nicely paced, energetic and entertaining enough in 3D. And as an underdog story, its message is positive and simple enough - one should never give up one one's dreams and aspirations in life, no matter what the odds.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:<em> </em></strong><em>Retired black-ops CIA agent Frank Moses teams up with his fellow agents in a quest to locate a missing and deadly nuclear device.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The idea of retired CIA operatives (read: killers) being pressed back into service in the face of mortal danger isn't new. In this case, the fun lies in the execution. And with the kind of multifaceted cast that this film has, there's bound to be some surprises. Frank (Willis) has settled down with Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker, from the first part of *Red*) into a somewhat humdrum routine. It turns out that Frank and his former eccentric and intelligent partner Marvin Boggs (Malkovich, excellent) helped smuggle a nuclear device called 'Nightshade' (a metal briefcase containing a nuclear bomb) into Russia during the Cold War. Boggs subsequently faked his own death to get off the espionage radar, until the present day. The US government decides that they want the device and declare Boggs, Frank and Sarah to be terrorists. And so, the chase begins.<br>
<br>
Russian agent Katja (Zeta-Jones), who also happens to be Frank's past paramour, is after Nightshade too. The Pentagon enlists MI6 agent Victoria (Helen Mirren) and hit-man Han Cho Bai (Byung-hun Lee) to locate them. It turns into a pan-European chase. Only Edward Bailey (Hopkins, totally on point), the scientist who created Nightshade, can help them find it. Juxtaposed in the midst of all this action are Frank and Sarah's relationship issues.<br>
<br>
And even in the midst of all the action, there's never a missed opportunity for the couple to receive relationship advice from anyone, be it the bumbling Boggs, Han of the furious fisticuffs or even cold-blooded Victoria. There are some tantalizing twists and turns that keep you looking forward to what happens next. Willis does his action-comedy routine adroitly. With nicely-timed sequences stitched together and gags galore, the humour in the film positively crackles! Or, as Bailey often says, 'Jolly good!'<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>The White House is hijacked by terrorists. The US army is helpless as there's a hostage situation. Can a lone policeman rescue his daughter and the US President?</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Hollywood seems to be obsessed with 'destruction' of late. Movies revolving around attacks of epic proportions by aliens, zombies, pandemics or terrorists seem to be the much sought-after theme, <em>World War Z, Man of Steel </em>and <em>Pacific Rim</em> being recent ones. Master of disaster films, Roland Emmerich, adds to the ongoing trend as he too sticks to his trademark genre. This time around, he blows up the White House (on the lines of <em>Olympus Has Fallen</em>) and, in spite of being formulaic, manages to deliver a fairly engaging film.<br>
<br>
Capitol Policeman John Cale (Channing Tatum) wishes to join the US secret service, the team in charge of the President's (Jamie Foxx) security. His young daughter Emily (Joey King) is a political geek. Thus, when opportunity arises, in order to impress her, John takes her along for his big interview at the White House. However, their special day turns out to be war day, when the historical building is invaded, ransacked and torn apart by 'American' terrorists, who capture the President and have other nefarious motives.<br>
<br>
<em>White House Down</em> is as predictable as it can get. In spite of the clichéd plot, it is still an explosion-filled action spectacle that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Fans of the genre will love the prolonged action sequences, intense gunfire, helicopters crashing into buildings, hide-and-seek between the cops, hostages and criminals and the overall massive destruction.<br>
<br>
But <em>WHD</em> is not just an action-thriller. After a while, when the loud explosions seem repetitive, it's the humour that keeps you engrossed. Mention of tunnels at the White House, hinting at the JFK-Marilyn affair, was hilarious. Banter between Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx is pleasant but inadequate. Nicolas Wright (as the tourist guide and loyal White House admirer) deserves a special mention for he has great comic timing.<br>
<br>
The film has its share of unconvincing moments but if 'One-man-saving-the-world' is your thing and if over-the-top, escapist action is what you seek, <em>White House Down</em> delivers all of that.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:<em> </em></strong><em>Intergalactic monsters called the Kaiju are unleashed from a rift in the Pacific Ocean to wipe out humanity. Only a force of equally gigantic robots created by man called the Jaegers can thwart them.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Stripped down, this movie is essentially about giant robots and giant sea monsters bashing each other up. The Jaeger robots are so large that they require two human operators to form a 'drift' (or a 'neural bridge') with each other to act as the left-brain and right-brain hemispheres controlling the mecha-robots from within. The Jaegers are then airlifted out to sea for a supersized slugfest with the Kaiju. Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) had lost his brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) to the Kaiju and the neural bridge allowed Becket to feel his co-driver brother's pain in his time of dying.<br>
<br>
Commanding officer Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) later plans a last-ditch effort to knock out the Kaiju once and for all at their source point. Burned-out Becket is recalled into service to command his old Jaeger called Gipsy Danger with Mako Mori (Kikuchi). Mori's own need for revenge against the Kaiju is convincing. She is perfect for her role. Other than that, Del Toro has populated their fellow Jaeger combatants with stereotypes - stoic Russians, bellicose Australians, soft-spoken Orientals and two mad scientists who seek a cerebral solution.<br>
<br>
The visuals are undeniably great and so are the effects. You'll even get to see a Jaeger bludgeon a Kaiju with a cargo ship. But the visuals will have to be this film's calling card because the ballast that holds it back is generic acting, monster film clichés and a sparse script. Ron Perlman, notwithstanding a tiny role, manages to shine as Hannibal Chau.<br>
<br>
The effort to inject romance between Mori and Becket is redundant. For once though, the battle for the planet is being fought someplace other than the USA. Although the story line is passable, the real stars in<em> Pacific Rim </em>are the Jaegers.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>Can you ever escape who you really are? The film is a crime biopic on hitman Richard Kuklinski, who adored his family, but didn't regret killing over 100 people, for money, out of anger or just to cover up his own crimes!</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>The film gives a disturbing account of Kuklinski's life from being a porn distributor to becoming one of the most diabolical contract killers in American history. Since he kept his family in the dark, they continued to live off his blood money until he got arrested in 1986 in an undercover operation. How he led a double life all those years - by playing a doting family man and a cold-blooded killer - is what forms the story.<br>
<br>
The Iceman is grim, dark and gritty. A certain sense of paranoia engulfs the proceedings, which helps build the psychological tension. Vromen manages to capture the period setting required. The background score is unsettling and does complete justice to the film's creepy theme. Michael Shannon is outstanding as the devilishly smooth deadpan psychopath, as passionate about the wellbeing of his family as about staring at his victims before he brutally murdered them. He gives a solid performance as the soulless, unsmiling man who solely cared for his family and had no qualms about confessing he felt that way, either.<br>
<br>
Shannon arrests your attention and sends shivers down your spine with his impeccable portrayal, especially in scenes where he struggles to hide his inner monster from his family. However, the film becomes sluggish after a while as the script relies heavily on Shannon's acting. The story runs out of steam as you sit through a series of generic mafia wars and killings. The scenes start looking repetitive and events monotonous. Fortunately, it all culminates in a gripping climax.<br>
<br>
Winona Ryder as Kuklinski's wife and Ray Liotta are effective. Chris Evans and James Franco make special appearances, making you wonder why they did so! The film works as a documentary.<br>
<br>
However, it fails to dramatise the character in order to evoke an audience reaction, which is what is usually expected from crime thrillers.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong><em> The Lone Ranger's fable is told from the Native American warrior Tonto's perspective, in a tale where Texas Ranger, John Reid, and he team up to take revenge on a common enemy.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>You've seen Johnny Depp playing a sozzled, swaying pirate with the luck of the devil by his side. Now, here's Depp, sans the sauce and in Native American garb as Tonto, with the devil-may-care attitude still in place.<br>
<br>
A group of Rangers are sent to capture Cavendish (Fichtner) hiding out in the mountains. However, they are ambushed by Cavendish and his men and gunned down from high ground, like fish in a barrel. Cavendish brutally cuts out Reid's (Hammer) brother's heart while the latter is still alive and eats it. The rest are left for the vultures. Reid is reluctantly rescued from the jaws of death in the unforgiving Texas desert by Tonto, who calls him a 'weak, paleface wetbrain'.<br>
<br>
Tonto loathes the savage greed of the 'palefaces' for having wiped out his entire tribe. They partner against a common foe, with different methods of meting out justice. Along the way, there are many campfire-quality tales of how the West was won and at what cost and sacrifice. There are moving moments - villages wiped out for pieces of silver. The other 'moving' moments, however, happen at breakneck speed, with thundering locomotives set on a collision course in a satisfying climax. The old theme music fits perfectly in that scene, where the action is timed down to the split second.<br>
<br>
The characters in the film read like a rustic country song. Carter plays a bar-room queen with a carved ivory leg. There are brigands who swill rotgut like water. An 'origin tale', the visuals show great attention to detail and Depp's Tonto is, without a doubt, the best thing about this movie. In fact, it is Reid who is Tonto's sidekick here.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>Back from Afghanistan, a homeless former Royal Marine gets an opportunity to change his identity. It is a decision that alters his life.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> A glance at the film poster might suggest that Jason Statham (playing Joey Jones) with his thousand-yard stare has just done what he usually does in movies - busting skulls and breaking bones from beginning to end. Not so here. Hummingbird has him on the biggest tangent of his career.<br>
<br>
A bum on the mean streets of back-alley London, fate (or God, as he puts it) lands him in the vacant house of someone really loaded. Jones realises that this is his chance at getting his life together again. He decides to assume the identity of the apartment's owner. What he doesn't realise is that slipping into a second skin can only go that far.<br>
<br>
Jones soon slides into London's dark underworld, populated by the Chinese and Russian mafia, using his combat training for cash. Suffering from guilt-ridden hallucinations, he uses vodka to allay his post-combat demons. He tries to redeem himself by using the ill-gotten money to buy good food for the homeless and nice things for a nun called Cristina (Agata Buzek) who runs a makeshift soup kitchen. An urban Robin Hood? No, not quite.<br>
<br>
Cristina is his 'angel'. She is the epitome of empathy and represents all that is good to him - the better person that he knows he can never again become. She senses his turmoil and is not put off. They are both damaged and in a city that is a sea of strangers, their stories are irrevocably intertwined.<br>
<br>
Dialogues are sparse and minimal, thankfully so. The score (Dario Marianelli) elegantly fills in the silences, speaking volumes. It is intense, but thanks to the editing, steers away from being drippy. Statham's stony visage tries to emote, often successfully. If this film marks a new direction for Statham's career, he's on the right track.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>Cops with wildly different temperaments are forced to work together on a case. Will they keep their differences aside and work as a team?</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Uptight New Yorker Sarah Ashburn (Sandra Bullock) is an FBI agent. She is 'Miss I-know-it-all', who is hated by her colleagues for being overtly competitive and unapologetic about her competence as a law enforcer. She even competes with the sniffer dogs of her squad with an intention of outshining them!<br>
<br>
Ashburn is sent to Boston to crack a case, where she is forced to work with cocky and short-tempered Shannon Mullins (Melissa McCarthy). Shannon has to have her way while dealing with criminals. Can the cleanliness freak from New York put up with the control freak of Boston and work together despite having nothing in common?<br>
<br>
The Heat is not hot enough to leave you spellbound. It even loses steam once in a while, owing to certain clichéd sequences and a standard storyline. For instance, the cops will have to undergo a makeover and dance clumsily at a nightclub to nab criminals, etc.<br>
<br>
But what makes this predictable film fun is the quirky chemistry between its leading ladies (Bullock and McCarthy). The women are masters of comedy. Most of the humour comes from a volley of snide comments the two pass at each other. Given that the ladies are effortlessly quick and clever at it, the trick works. Even in portions where the fun element drops, the two make up for it with their repartee and bizarre attempts to keep the city clean. We've always seen male cop buddies hit it off, here's one with a difference. Luckily, the sensibility isn't that of a formulaic-chick-flick either.<br>
<br>
Given the genre, who better than Sandra Bullock to be at the helm of the proceedings? The Proposal and Miss Congeniality star is in top form once again. Matching her brilliance is Melissa McCarthy. If you wanted to see more of her in Hangover 3 and felt let down by her cameo, this is your chance.<br>
<br>
If you don't expect buddy cop movies to be vastly unique, The Heat is fairly entertaining.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>In this prequel to Monsters Inc, find out how Mike Wazowski and James P 'Sulley' Sullivan became buddies while in college and eventually, scarers.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Mike (Crystal) and Sulley (Goodman) weren't always the best of friends. Before landing up in their jobs as professional scarers at Monsters Inc, they were two very different individuals. One was the enterprising bookworm who wanted to go places while the other was a legacy (the child of a famous ex-student) who everybody wanted to hang around.<br>
<br>
In fact, there are certain traits of the main characters in this film that stand out as reminders to their older selves seen in Inc. While a stern headmistress (Mirren, pulling off a Maggie Grace a la Professor McGonagall) doesn't think the pea-shaped Mike can't scare a child even if he wanted to, he sets out to prove her wrong after being kicked off the scaring course. A scarers' contest follows (Revenge of the Nerds or Student of The Year coming to mind, anyone?) where fraternities face off each other.<br>
<br>
What follows is a fight to stay 'on course'. An unlikely ragtag team slugs it out against the best of the lot for pride and a chance at glory.<br>
<br>
The film starts out while Mike is in school and on a field trip to the Monsters Inc facility. A chance meeting with a legendary scarer has him chalking out career plans which hit the reality speedbreaker when he crosses paths with Sulley.<br>
<br>
The sorting of friends and foes and the actual discoveries of what's real and what's not is what makes up the rest of the story.<br>
<br>
Crystal and Goodman retain the chemistry that made the first film such a good buddy flick. Don Scanlan takes over the reins and shows a confident touch. The animation is as realistic and top-notch as ever.<br>
<br>
But what really is striking is the fact that a lot of the things that made Monsters Inc such a beloved film are missing here. The sharper dialogues, crisper editing and the more layered story and characters that were the highlights of Inc don't exist in the world of University.<br>
<br>
What remains is a predictable college caper that you have inevitably grown up with or endured over the years. The cliches, the stereotypes and other banalities of a film of this genre are magnified and made annoyingly kid-friendly.<br>
<br>
It's not a bad film. Far from that. It is actually quite enjoyable when watched for its own merits and with the entire family. It's endearing in parts. But compare it to Monsters Inc, and it falls quite short on charm.<br>

<strong>Review:</strong> Will Smith is known to do films with a bang - grand movies of sweeping scale where he is the focal point of attention. Not so in this one. Here, he takes the back seat and hands Jaden the baton (obvious metaphors abound; he gives the kid his own saber at the commencement of the quest) to be the main man.<br>
<br>
The film is set hundreds of years into the future, where mankind has been evacuated from Earth; a planet now inhabited by human-eating nasties. Cypher Raige (Smith) and his son Kitai Raige (Jaden) are forced to crash-land. The film’s plot bears an uncanny resemblance to a video-game where the player has to go the distance from point ‘A’ to ‘B’ (100 km, in this case) in ‘X’ amount of time. Along the way he battles monsters of increasing strength. There are health packs too, like bonus points. And in the end, there is a ‘boss fight’ with a hideous alien critter called the Ursa. That’s it, game over.<br>
<br>
Cypher maintains a radio link with Kitai as the harsh patriarch at times and the voice of reason-cum-vendor of wisdom and encouragement at other times. Again it’s like how a computer-programmed narrator is in a video-game. At some point, they lose contact and Kitai’s moment of reckoning arrives. It’s about Kitai having to prove himself to his dad.<br>
<br>
The rest of the cast is inconsequential, forgettable and completely replaceable. There are menacing moments and the editing is taut but this stays in cliché territory; it’s nothing you haven’t seen before. The film suffers from a lack of ambition. <em>After Earth</em> aims for interstellar overdrive but barely manages to take off.

<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>The convoluted case is assigned to FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) and French Interpol officer Alma Dray (Mélanie Laurent). Post the robberies, the gang leaves no trace. They don’t steal for themselves. Their misleading actions and ambiguous motives drive Rhodes to the edge. Adding to the chaos is former magician Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) who thinks he knows it all.<br>
<br>
The film has a novel and promising premise. The gang’s cat and mouse game with the FBI, their display of magic tricks, fluid stunt scenes and Mark Ruffalo’s banter with co-cop Mélanie Laurent keep you engaged. The film works as a crime-thriller.<br>
<br>
However, it’s unconvincing when it comes to dissecting the magic. As the film progresses, the antics of the law-defying ‘famous four’ start defying logic as well. The scattered plot runs out of steam eventually. The film goes into a different tangent altogether in order to be unpredictable, leaving you more perplexed than pleased.<br>
<br>
Scene after scene, in order to not let you dig into the script too closely, the filmmaker adds too many plot twists, but that does not camouflage the loose ends.<br>
<br>
The presence of a talented cast barely holds here as the characters are thinly sketched. Jesse Eisenberg yet again plays a fast-talking-shrewd guy with negative undertones like he did in The Social Network. And what is Michael Caine doing here?<br>
<br>
The film has its moments, especially in the scene when the magicians teleport an audience member to France from Vegas in a few minutes. However, don’t go thinking you’ll have fun ‘solving’ the enigmatic case, as the events that follow might just be way too implausible and convenient for your liking.<br>
<br>
The magicians in the film constantly warn the FBI officer to ‘not look too closely’. The filmmaker sends out a similar message to the audience – don’t dig into every aspect of the ‘tricks’ and you will be entertained.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>The classic Cinderella story is given a cowboy-themed, Wild West style makeover. This time, it is Cinderella who does the rescuing, along with a group of friends. </em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> This is probably the most extreme deviation from the classic Cinderella tale that you will have seen so far. Made by the French (its original French title is Cendrillon au Far West), with English overdubbing in curious accents, this avatar of Cinderella is no cowering wallflower. She’s a cowgirl who swaps the ball gown for a pair of jeans. Life is fairly humdrum for everybody until she hops on an action-packed quest to save the mother of a prince who has been kidnapped by a group of gorilla pirates. Another big change – the glass slipper here is a missing tooth. And there’s no fairy godmother; here, Cinderella has a simpering shaman to help her with the bits involving magic.<br>
<br>
The rendering and colours, though saturated, are several pegs below the kind of top-notch work that lovers of the animation genre expect to see in films these days. The animals are all anthropomorphic and yet, it’s not easy to figure out who is what. For example, Cinderella looks like a talking dog with pigtails that rides what seems to be an ostrich. The pirates, dressed in seafaring garb, operate in what looks like an arid desert and for some reason mariachi music seems to permeate most of the film. It’s a puzzling combination that does not sit right. While creative adaptations to fairytales are all very well, this one is just too much of an aggregation of parts that does not make up a wholesome whole.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>A teenage girl lands up in an enchanted forest, the scene for a showdown between the forces of good and evil. What lies at stake is the fate of the forest and the world.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>A forest inhabited by tiny dwellers, an eccentric genius scientist obsessed with discovering their existence, and an estranged father-daughter relationship. These are some of the elements cobbled together in <em>Epic</em>. Added to this is the familiar trope of the unlikely hero, Nod (Josh Hutcherson) getting the girl, Mary Catherine (Amanda Seyfried) - a little love story served up on the side.<br>
<br>
Leader of the Leafmen is the battle-seasoned Ronin (Farrell). Queen of the Leafmen, Tara (Beyoncé Knowles) is reminiscent of Tinkerbell. Out to destroy the Leafmen and all life in the forest (for reasons unexplained) are the evil Boggans.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Mary lands up at her dad's (Professor Bomba, voiced by Sudeikis) house, which is in the forest, to spend some quality time with him. However, much to her chagrin, she realises that he's bothered more about the quest to prove the existence of the tiny forest people. Disappointed, she prepares her return to the city, but a chance encounter with a fatally-injured Tara and a wacky turn of events leads her to shrink size and become part the Leafmen vs. Boggans battle.<br>
<br>
Bufo the toad (Pitbull), Mub the slug (Aziz Ansari) and Nim Galuu (Aerosmith's Steven Tyler) are pretty funny. The animation makes everything look quite vivid, but doesn't break new ground in the VFX department. Also, it takes more than a star-cast providing voice-overs to make an animated flick really rock. Yes, the ingredients are in place but somehow, it doesn't engage you at the emotional level that say, a <em>Toy Story</em> did. And neither does it present something truly unique as <em>Wall-E</em> did.<br>
<br>
Other than that, the film is adequate. It's sometimes slapstick, sometimes emotional, and funny at times. All in all though, the ambitiously-titled Epic is in fact anything but epic.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>The film is a gripping adaptation of Pakistani author Mohsin Hamid's acclaimed novel on conflicting ideologies and a search for identity, beyond religion.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Can you be who you really are when the world around you forces you to believe otherwise? 9/11 changed the West's perception of Islam forever. While various films have had the unsettling issue as a backdrop, Mira Nair's riveting adaptation goes way deeper. Its sensitive yet unsubtle narrative succeeds at retaining the book's ambiguity, as well as raising pertinent questions on Islamic fundamentalism, emigration and USA's interference in Pakistan. Nair captures the finer nuances of the thought-provoking tale with great conviction.<br>
<br>
Hard-working immigrant Changez Khan (Riz Ahmed) is happy living his American dream. Confident and talented, he's considered as a promising financial analyst at the renowned Wall Street business valuation firm, Underwood Samson. While he's busy climbing the corporate ladder and finding love in Erica (Hudson), an artist, the twin towers are attacked. As a Muslim in the US, the act of extreme violence not only shatters hopes of Changez's bright future, but also makes him question his ideologies, objectivity and identity.<br>
<br>
The beauty of the film lies in the depiction of its protagonist's unspoken words, suppressed emotions and unwavering beliefs. The incredibly talented Riz Ahmed enables the film to deconstruct the meaning of 'fundamentalism', which forms the core of the story. What leaves you in awe of the adapted screenplay is its brilliantly drawn parallels between Changez's personal, political and social situation. You feel his pain, vulnerability, denial, inner turmoil and psychological conflict. The film keeps you thoroughly engaged, even in parts where the pace drops a bit. While the film is more of a thriller, it doesn't cease to be a human drama, thanks to sublime supporting performances from Kate Hudson, Liev Schreiber, Kiefer Sutherland, Om Puri, Shabana Azmi and Meesha Shafi.<br>
<br>
The music is soulful. Songs like <em>Kangna, Bijli Aaye ya na aaye</em> help build the mood. Cinematography is impressive and in sync with Nair's trademark style of storytelling. Poignant and relevant, the film will convince you to look at Pakistan differently.<br>

<strong>Movie Review: </strong>It's emotions versus practicality and the needs of the many versus the needs of a few that's the underlining message in this, most recent Trekkie outing. James Kirk (Chris Pine) is a brash and bold risk taker with an ego to match. Spock, of course, is the cold, calculating, logical Vulcan voice of reason. The film has situations aplenty that calls for use of both their approaches. The opening scene has them beating a hasty exit from an alien planet, featuring exotic, crimson flora that sears the screen. They're there to save the planet from extinction by plugging up a volcano.

	<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and his best friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) are a 21st century Huckleberry Finn-style duo. They ride scooters, fish, sail, know every inch of their Arkansas hometown and even find a secret hideaway on an island - a boat stuck atop a tree! But their island idyll and the boat have an inhabitant. His name is Mud.<br>
	<br>
	Tattooed, superstitious, dishevelled and packing a .45 calibre, Mud (McConaughey) tells the boys that he's a fugitive, dodging bounty-hunting assassins. He's also trying to trace his girl Juniper (Witherspoon, oozing sex appeal) who's a hoochie gal with a soft heart for bad boys. Mud makes a deal with the two - he offers Neck his .45 in return for food. Intrigued and charmed in equal measure, the boys agree. But is Mud a man worth helping? Is he a good guy caught between a rock and a hard place or a scoundrel with no scruples, who plays the sympathy card well?</p>
<p>
	A grizzled Sam Shephard - a deadshot with a sniper rifle - knows Mud since childhood and warns the kids about him. But Ellis, who'd like to see Mud and Juniper reunite, and Neck, the deadpan-delivery voice of reason, pay no heed. A coming-of-age story with more than a few moments of menace, the film's languid pace matches the humid atmosphere of the Mississippi delta setting. The visuals are amazing, with a tinge of surrealism. The cinematography is lush and the dialogues deftly delivered. The Southern folks embody values like trust, a good work ethic, honesty and loyalty. Ellis is, however, the true hero of this film.</p>

<strong>Movie Review: </strong>The film grabs you as early as the action-packed opening hunt sequence with a quick character introduction along with a gander at other prehistoric creatures that could only have come out of someone's imagination.<br>
<br>
The story. Well, it's a fairly simple one. Something not quite unlike another recent release about a prehistoric family (of woolly mammoths and other assorted friends) plot-wise. The detailing, rendering, textures and stereography in Croods, however, is miles ahead of that film. Some scenes are worth watching out for.<br>
<br>
The voice cast in The Croods is competent, the gags come thick and fast and almost never let up, leaving you in guffaws more often than not. The new spin brought to an old concept actually works with limited characters. Despite the predictable premise, you're eager to see what comes next. The movie cruises along at a healthy running time and that's actually a blessing as most films in the genre tend to be over-indulgent. A fresh, fun and mostly footloose feature, you wish there was more to the story than just a race 'into the light'. The premise's inherent simplicity is just as easily its only undoing.<br>

<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> A washed-out looking Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan appear at the beginning of the equally washed-out version of this franchise, kicking off a string of puerile scenes held together by no sense of logic or reason.<br>
<br>
The only semblance of a ‘plot’ this film has is when a couple, Jody and Dan (Ashley Tisdale and Simon Rex, respectively), move into a new home with their baby son and immediately afterwards, start to experience all kinds of ‘events’ that range from mildly depraved to downright psychotic. They then try to get to the bottom of these strange happenings.<br>
<br>
It’s as if someone with a 5-year-old’s sense of humour has been given free rein to make a film and gone overboard with – quite literally – toilet humour.<br>
<br>
For the rest of it, the movie relies heavily on send-ups from<em> Paranormal Activity, Mama and Evil Dead</em>. Rise of the Planet of the Apes also gets its own goofball version here. It actually might seem that the apes manage to put on a better act than some of the real-life cast members. And who could have thought that even a movie like Inception could be spoofed? This scene starts off funnily but soon loses steam.<br>
<br>
The genuinely funny bits (about five or so) seem to be clustered at the beginning. Snoop Lion knows how to deliver a good laugh and Sheen has made self-deprecating humour his new ‘thing’. Lohan is just plain embarrassing to watch. And it goes downhill from there. Tolerable in small doses, it looks like it has been cobbled together from random sequences. However, while the Scary Movie series has always been slapstick, a handful of funny bits do not make a successful comedy.

Spectacular images of planetary ruin, ravaged surfaces, barren landscapes, floating houses on the clouds, futuristic aircrafts, powerful drones and the strength of a complex restless mind, Oblivion manages to capture the beauty of it all with astounding reality.<br>
<br>
In terms of story-telling, the film stays unpredictable, thus convincing us to patiently wait as the mystery unfolds, even when it feels a tad directionless at times. Like a novel, the film stays unputdownable till the end.<br>
<br>
After Jack Reacher, 'I-want-to-be-versatile' Tom Cruise once again slips into a role which does not require his trademark charm or good looks and succeeds better this time as the role doesn't require him to be stoic either. Cruise displays the inner turmoil of his character brilliantly, in spite of not having any memorable dialogues at his disposal. Unfortunately, Morgan Freeman is wasted.<br>
<br>
Oblivion is primarily a great visual experience. The mystifying sombreness of a post-apocalyptic earth has been captured brilliantly.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>A daredevil motorcycle rider resorts to robbing banks to support his newborn son and lover. It is a decision that proves to have major consequences.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> It's the opening, retro-cool extended tracking shot where Luke (Ryan Gosling) gets ready for his daredevil biking act that first gets you. The camera follows him from his trailer to the Big Top, where two other riders await him. They go about their act, eliciting gasps of awe, before the frame ends. It's like a metaphor for the entire movie. Separate lives, yet intertwined in an intricately-constructed ride.<br>
<br>
His former lover, Romina (Eva Mendes) walks into his life again. Soon, Luke finds out Romina's got a baby son. Sincere to a fault, he quits his act and embarks on a tag team bank robbery spree with grimy backwoods mechanic Robin (Ben Mendelsohn). All of this, so he can buy stuff for his baby and hand Romina wads of dollar bills. Although never too far from his dirt bike, he loves his role as father and provider.<br>
<br>
The second 'act' of the movie belongs to Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper), a cop-with-a-conscience who stays away from histrionics. A collision with Luke becomes inevitable. Stone-faced Deluca (Ray Liotta) is the dirty cop played to perfection.<br>
<br>
While the only weak link is Avery's kid AJ Cross (Emory Cohen), Dane DeHaan (Luke and Romina's teenage son, Jason) is someone to watch out for. Essentially three films cohesively segued into one, the narrative's complexity never once becomes overwrought.<br>
<br>
An ambitious film, Cianfrance aims for higher ground, and gets there with ease. Ryan Gosling's act gives method acting a new meaning - it is elegance in itself. And incidentally, the English translation of the Mohawk word Schenectady (the town where the movie unfolds), is 'the place beyond the pines'.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note: </strong>You will not like this film if you don't like dramatic movies about inter-connected lives.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>Spielberg's 1993 epic blockbuster has been re-mastered into 3D, so that fans can revisit the classic in theatres, while the younger ones can get introduced to the cult dinosaur disaster movie with enhanced viewing experience.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>There is something about disaster films that make us want to watch them over and over again. While watching others battle hard to survive a catastrophe, you subconsciously become those characters, which ensures an adrenalin rush. Their fear and courage engulf you, enabling you to live the adventure you see on the big screen. Who better than Steven Spielberg to help you do so!<br>
<br>
20 years back, ripples were not just created in the glasses of water kept on the dashboard of a car in the film's iconic scene, marking the thunderous footsteps of an approaching dinosaur, but also at the box office as the 'first-of-its-kind' eco-horror took the audiences by storm. The re-release of the triple Oscar-winning movie gives you an opportunity to watch the lunging velociraptors and T. Rexes in 3D.<br>
<br>
But before the fun part (dinosaur attack) begins, the opening half of the film does seem a bit 'old-fashioned' in its slow and gradual build-up. Lectures on the science of 'cloning dinosaurs', DNA, etc., along with an introduction to the paleontologists and scientists who are invited to millionaire John Hammond's (Richard Attenborough) island theme park 'Jurassic Park' for a preview make you a tad impatient. Post-that, you are kept on the edge of your seat till the end, with not just impactful CGI and 3D but also by striking an emotional chord with you.<br>
<br>
Dr. Alan Grant's (Sam Neill) rapport with the kids, Ian Malcolm's (Jeff Goldblum) sharp one-liners and John Hammond's (Richard Attenborough) heartfelt love for his dangerous theme park is simply wonderful.<br>
<br>
In times of Life of Pi and Avatar, the 3D doesn't seem outstanding but nowhere does it fall short of giving you goosebumps, especially in the brilliant scene towards the end, when velociraptors stalk the kids in the kitchen. While Spielberg's story-telling still stays the film's USP, the 3D does add to its brilliance. Here's looking forward to Jurassic Park 4 in 2014!<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:<em> </em></strong><em>A 911 phone operator gets a call that leads her on a chase to rescue a young woman who has been kidnapped by a lunatic.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>The Call starts out promisingly enough: Jordan Turner (Halle Berry) is a police psychologist who does her 911 call centre day job with dedication, channeling emergency calls to the local cops. Autumn (Ella Rae Peck) and her pal Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin) enjoy their last lunch before the latter gets abducted by a psychotic Michael Foster (Michael Eklund). Turner gets a distress call from Casey which makes her revisit a gruesome memory from her own past. Turner breaks her own rule of not getting 'attached' to callers and takes it upon herself to play part-investigator, part-vigilante and help rescue the panic-stricken Casey who faces the danger of death.<br>
<br>
Considering that this is a movie where most of the time, two people are agitatedly talking (one screaming and the other cajoling) over the phone,the tension is taut. True to thriller-film methodology, there are plenty of edge-of-the-seat moments that will keep you glued to your seat. However, it is odd that Halle Berry, who has won an Oscar, would do these kinds of movies that hover between having a barely-there plot to being a bland mess.<br>
<br>
Eklund's character seems to be just thrown in without any explanation as to what made him a kidnapping, murderous lunatic. The cops come across as patsies who can't think for themselves and instead, rely on the harrowed Jordan for instructions about what to do next. The torment that Casey undergoes will get you in the gut. But what does it all amount to? Casey is almost reduced to a vehicle for Turner to exorcise her past demons. Nonetheless, it is Berry and Breslin's performances that keep this movie buoyant and provide the thrills.

<strong>Review: </strong>The Joes get sent to Pakistan to retrieve nuclear warheads but it all goes horribly wrong with the 'enemy' possibly being their own President. But why would he do that, right?<br>
<br>
Anyway, the survivors return, with Roadblock (Johnson) taking charge of the severely depopulated unit comprising Lady Jaye (Palicki) and Flint (D J Cotrona). Gen Joe Colton (Willis) reluctantly pitches in along with G.I Joe Snake Eyes and new recruit Jynx, bringing them closer to their enemy Cobra Commander and his minions Firefly (Stevenson) and Zartan (Vosloo).<br>
<br>
Director Jon Chu takes over from Stephen Sommers in the second installment of this toy-line-inspired franchise and that's surprising. Chu is best known for his dance films (<em>Step Up 2, Step Up 3D</em>) while Sommers is an all-action man, having former experience in helming a franchise exceedingly well (<em>The Mummy</em> series).<br>
<br>
To his credit, Chu doesn't disappoint, keeping your interest in the film unwavering at a sharp 115 minutes. For those unfamiliar with the characters, there's a visual introduction at the start. The action sequences impress and the banter is at par with the standard fare dished out these days.<br>
<br>
Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock is always a safe bet. Almost-Wonder Woman Adrianne Palicki is easy on the eyes and her brief chemistry with Bruce Willis is crackling indeed. Worth noting is one of the climax scenes that seems thought-provoking yet has been executed quite frivolously.<br>
<br>
That being said, this one's worth the price of the ticket and the 3D's actually not unnecessarily painful. Give it a shot. After all, revenge flicks are such guilty pleasures, no?

<strong>Movie Review</strong>: With Quentin Tarantino, there are no half measures.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>The White House is taken over by a group of terrorists and the US President is held hostage. It's up to a former Secret Service agent to eliminate the bad guys and free the President in a limited amount of time.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) loses his wife Margaret (Ashley Judd) during a road accident one bitterly cold night. It's an ominous portent of things to come. Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), who was in the motorcade on the night of the accident, blames himself for not averting that tragedy. Asher transfers Banning to a desk job that's devoid of action and excitement because every time he sees him, Asher is reminded of his loss.<br>
<br>
Banning's misery is soon alleviated in the unlikeliest of ways. A group of North Korean terrorists (along with plenty of outside help) overrun the White House, hold the President and his Cabinet hostage and make a bunch of demands that have to be met, 'or else'.<br>
<br>
Secret Service Director Lynn Jacobs (Angela Bassett) and the authoritative Speaker Alan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman, perfect for this kind of role) take charge, with Banning on the ground. The action (and the body count) sky-rockets here onwards. Banning channels his inner John McClane and unleashes systematic slaughter of the bad guys. In the process, the White House itself takes one heck of a pummeling. People are tortured, blown up, shot and killed in hand- to-hand combat. Banning's disdain for the enemy is only matched by the delight he derives from being able to prove himself.<br>
<br>
The action is taut, thanks to the editing. Although it does play on patriotic emotion and righteous anger, <em>'Olympus...</em> is mercifully low on excessive melodrama and jingoism. Furthermore, a few of Banning's muttered punchlines are genuinely funny. Despite being a formula-flick, <em>'Olympus...</em> is satisfying if you get your thrills from action movies.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>'Leatherface', the chainsaw-wielding psychotic killer, is back to brutally kill the youngsters who accidentally invade his privacy.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Ignoring various sequels made over the years, 'Texas Chainsaw 3D' begins where the original 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (1974) ended. With a terrific background score, the opening titles show us the crucial footage of the classic as a quick recap for those who are clueless about the slasher franchise.<br>
<br>
Sally, the only survivor of a gruesome attack in a farmhouse by a bunch of cannibals, especially the 'leatherface', manages to escape. This film begins with locals burning down the concerned house and its inhabitants, the 'Sawyers', in order to keep the town safe. Unaware of the brutal past, years later, Heather Miller (Alexandra Daddario) discovers she too is a Sawyer and visits her creepy hometown with her friends to check out the house she inherited. Turns out, it's not just the house she inherits!<br>
<br>
The film, like most American slasher films, defies logic. Without any inhibitions or inquiry, why would a girl accept some obscure mansion?! But logic is not expected in these series, so it's fine. The film fails to induce fear as the filmmaker is unable to create any psychological tension. The climax is a further letdown as the emotional twist does not work.<br>
<br>
But for those who seek cheap thrills, the typical slasher ingredients are in place. Nudity, boys who accompany skimpily clad girls to mysterious houses to get laid but get killed instead, huge mansions, secret dungeons, deceitful characters and a chainsaw killer who cuts up youngsters who invade his house..it's all there in standard 3D. Avoid, if you can't stand graphic violence.

<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) and Lancaster Dodd’s (Philip Seymour Hoffman) destinies seem intertwined. And yet, you’d never imagine so as both their worlds are really poles apart. Freddie is almost sub-human after his return from the war. Falling apart at the seams, he is charming but tormented, his features twisted. Adding to the fog in his brain is the effect of the moonshine he distils from photography fluid and other vile chemicals. He's a sex addict too.<br>
<br>
Dodd is the calm and composed leader of a nascent cult called The Cause, which is somewhat reminiscent of Scientology. The two meet when a drunken Freddie stows away on Dodd’s yacht after a night of drinking hooch. They soon become almost inseparable. Though Dodd is sometimes condescending towards Freddie, at other times, he tries to help him get over his past traumas. Freddie is as loyal to Dodd as a dog is toward his master. The both of them, however, are volatile. Lancaster’s wife Mary (Amy Adams) does not occupy centrestage here. But when she does, she is subtly manipulative and extremely perceptive.<br>
<br>
Set in the 1950s, the biggest theme of<em> The Master </em>is the disciple-mentor relationship that Quell and Dodd share. That, in effect, is the storyline. The cinematography (Mihai Malaimare, Jr.) is breathtaking and the music (Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood) is at times ominous, yet always augments the mood of a scene. This film is almost like a vehicle for Phoenix and Hoffman’s acting skills because both their performances are very engaging.<br>

Thanks to competition from a street magician and Burt's own humongous ego, their signature act and decade-long partnership ends....badly. Do they recover from the bad spell or lose the magic their friendship had?</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> A headlining cast like this is enough to convince you to buy a seat for this one. But as it turns out, not enough to keep you in it. The story is a truly plain connect-the-dots, its execution neither dazzling you with a spellbinding screenplay, nor keeping you enthralled with the illusions on display.<br>
<br>
Carell, going by his regular standards, feels like an extension of his character, Burt Wonderstone. We've seen it all, there's nothing new on offer. Ditto with Carrey, who, as Steve Gray (modelled on David Blaine?) is the slapstick will-do-anything-crazy to Carell's monotonous all-too-subtle deadpan.<br>
<br>
It is Alan Arkin as ageing magician and Burt's inspiration Rance Halloway, coming a little too late into the second half, who brings a rare grace, refreshing candour and understated chutzpah to the otherwise soul-less premise. He is the catalyst who drives the film forward.<br>
<br>
For a comedy, it's a little underwhelming. The magic tricks are more shock, less awe. Not as incredible or magical as one would expect. Could do a lot better.<br>

His son Jason Collins (Rafi Gavron) is not the brightest kid on the block - a flaw that has him facing the slammer for a good ten years, for unwittingly participating (rather, being duped) in a drug shipment. Jason can however benefit from a reduced sentence if he helps 'snitch' on some of the senior baddies in the cartel. The only problem is Jason is no criminal. The cops don't believe this.<br>
<br>
Sensing the danger his son is in, Matthews approaches the stony-faced District Attorney Joanne Keeghan (Susan Sarandon) and offers her a deal - he will do the dirty work himself. He will help the cops ensnare some of the criminals with Agent Cooper (Barry Pepper) monitoring from afar.<br>
<br>
The film tends to lose direction now and then with unnecessarily serious discussions and vague, philosophical cross-references that question the US justice system. You might find yourself wishing that they would just get on with the action instead because that is the film's strongest point.There are plot holes too. For example, no explanation is offered as to how an ordinary businessman (Matthews) is suddenly an expert at wielding arms and ammunition like a commando. Susan Sarandon does carry with her a sense of gravitas. Juan Carlos 'El Topo' Pintera (Benjamin Bratt) convincingly plays the cartel kingpin.<br>
<br>
Watch it if you like action films and are a Dwayne Johnson fan.

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Buddy flicks run by a formula you can more-or-less sleepwalk through.

There's enough in this film to make you want to lock up or chaperone your impressionable children, than any film in this genre.<br>

He fakes his identity for his selfish reasons until he stumbles across three witches and a flying monkey, the very naïve Theodora (Mila Kunis), her conniving sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and the good witch Glinda (Michelle Williams). Can the conman con the people of Oz too?<br>
<br>
When Disney adapts a classic fairy-tale, you can rest assured that the film would be nothing less than a visual spectacle which seamlessly blends physical sets with CGI. The 3D is spectacular. Do not miss out on the opening titles and scenes as they are shot in the gorgeous sepia tone. Once Oscar enters Oz, colours take over. The depiction of the dream-like parallel universe, located above the clouds, amidst lush green fields and serene waterfalls, takes your breath away.<br>
<br>
The film, however falters when it comes to the length and a few performances. The film is slightly overlong. James Franco lacks the charisma to pull off an iconic character. He seems laid back! Surprisingly, Mila Kunis looks equally out of place. Helena Bonham Carter would have been apt for her role. Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams are brilliant.<br>

It erupts into a gigantic beanstalk which reaches to the sky, taking Jack's house and Princess Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson) along with it. The beanstalk leads to the land of the giants. In order to rescue the princess, her conniving would-be groom Roderick (Stanley Tucci), love-struck Jack and the king's brave knight Elmont (Ewan McGregor) decide to face the giants, thus reigniting an ancient war.<br>
<br>
Adapting a classic fairytale into a feature film still seems like a distant dream, considering most of the recent attempts have been mediocre. Be it <em>Snow White and the Huntsman</em>,<em> Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel</em>, and now <em>Jack the Giant Slayer</em> which has borrowed elements from both <em>Jack the Giant Killer</em> and <em>Jack and the Beanstalk. </em>The films have been unable to recreate the magic of the classic fables.<br>
<br>
Bryan Singer, who has made films like <em>X-Men</em> and <em>Valkyrie</em>, finds it difficult to keep the audience engaged, let alone be entertained. CGI giants which are supposed to be the USP of the film seem caricaturish and one-dimensional. They don't seem menacing at all. Even the evil Roderick looks cartoonish. Jack, the hero, seems inexcusably dumb while you wonder what Ewan McGregor is doing in this soul-less film!<br>
<br>
The film is painfully predictable and the romance awfully sweet. An elongated tug-of-war scene between the humans and giants does not qualify for an epic battle scene and that's the biggest drawback.<br>

The 3D is lacklustre and the SFX unable to salvage the uninteresting script. Children may find this film amusing, thanks to the art direction and story-telling style. For the rest, if only the story was modified better!

<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Straight up, Silver Linings Playbook (SLP) is a lovely movie with a heart of caramel - and an occasionally brilliant mind. Teacher Patrick Solatano's (Cooper) wife Nikki has a superiority complex - and an affair. Pat attacks her lover, Nikki leaves, Pat's diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put into a facility. Eight months later, his mum Dolores (Weaver) has him discharged on condition he'll stay with her and dad Pat Sr. (De Niro) - and away from Nikki.<br>
<br>
Optimist Pat's one aim is getting better, so Nikki will take him back. But he meets depressive Tiffany (Lawrence), whose grief at losing her husband turns her briefly to compulsive sex, helping whom - by partnering together for a dance competition - might help Pat win Nikki back. But first, Pat must deal with his obsessive-compulsive father, friend Danny (Tucker) whose mental health status isn't quite certain, therapist Dr. Patel (Kher) who plays the one song that triggers Pat's rage - and his own increasingly crazy feelings for Tiffany.<br>
<br>
The acting simply shines - Cooper is magnificent as handsome oddball Pat, struggling to keep it sane, while Lawrence is a treat, her sadness-tinged sexiness like a modern Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's. Others deliver too, De Niro superbly superstitious about TV remotes during football games, Weaver strong as silk as a supportive mom, Tucker hilariously urging Pat and Tiffany to 'black up' their dancing, Kher calmly noting, 'That's very, very manic indeed.'<br>
<br>
The story's endearingly intelligent - 'I apologise on behalf of Ernest Hemmingway!' yells Pat breaking a window, outraged by a novel's sad ending - perfumed by quirky, unconventional romance, celebrating a love for life that hurts and heals together. There are tiny quibbles - it could've had a tangent less - but at the end, you're left with pure silver lining and no cloud.<br>

Jack, on the other hand, is on his own secret mission, which gets obstructed with his dad's arrival. Can the wise-cracking dad and his wayward son keep their differences aside to kick some ass?<br>

Diehard fans of Bruce Willis may not mind the shoddy CGI or poor story in this fifth installment of the franchise as he makes up for the flaws with his sheer presence, but somewhere, it's still not enough. The dialogues are barely witty; father-son chemistry fails to touch your heart. Story progresses hastily, thus conveniently leaving ample plot holes.<br>
<br>
The film is a carnival of mindless action, which may appeal to the action junkies, provided you don't expect 'practicality'. The action scenes are not convincing enough to keep you engaged. They fail to create the tension required. Having said that, the film does not have dull moments either, the method in the madness is what is missing.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>Four years into America's terrible Civil War, Southern surrender looks likely - but will President Lincoln end the war before abolishing slavery?</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> One line by Republican politician Thaddeus Stevens sums up Abraham Lincoln's historic feat - 'Corruption aided by the purest man in America.'<br>
<br>
Indeed, Lincoln shows us a whole new side to the ending of American slavery, taking us behind blood-stained fields of war into the backrooms of real politics, chambers where representatives cut sharp deals, attics where lobbyists haggle 'patronage-pay', corners of grand Houses where leaders drop their bluster and name their price. This is a clever, cynical graph of the mathematics that went into Abraham Lincoln's philosophy - underlining how a great statesman was a shrewd salesman too.<br>
<br>
In drawing Lincoln thus, Day-Lewis delivers a molten, silken performance, etched like an ivory statue whose eyes glisten occasionally at the ironies he sees. These are often lost on those around him - most notably, on his neurotic wife Mary, played by Field with edgy, brittle flair as she berates Lincoln for being coldly uncaring, imprisoning his family 'within this terrible house!' His wife isn't his only challenge - Lincoln faces opposition from his party, rivals, even his staff. Here, Lincoln scores big again - despite Day-Lewis' dazzling performance, other political players come to life too, including David Strathairn as velveteen Secretary of State Seward and Lee Jones as the brilliantly blunt Stevens.<br>
<br>
Marshalling these forces - plus a little flock of lobbyists - Lincoln induces the House to finally debate abolishing slavery. His obsession to push his idealism - even at the cost of delaying ending the war - reveals itself as deadly sharp through all that wafting smoke and shadowy silhouettes, interlaced with Lincoln's numerous meandering parables.<br>
<br>
On the downside, Lincoln is long-winded, clutching strands - like the President's sons - that needlessly distract from its pointed political play. Its first half's slow, the second quicker but deep-set in American minutiae. Still, as one of its senators finally roars, 'God damn it - I'm voting yes.'<br>

The film works brilliantly as a psychological thriller, which constantly plays with your mind. Andrés Muschietti does not resort to cheap gore or clichéd ghost appearances to give you the creeps. He leaves you shell-shocked instead as he plays around with shadows, mysterious evil noises and baffling supernatural occurrences. <em>Mama</em> is atmospheric and the haunting mood of the film impressively never goes down. The film does resemble <em>Paranormal Activity</em> a bit minus the ‘found footage’ cinematography, but this one’s way scarier and less static.<br>
<br>
When it comes to the plot, the back-story is not explained clearly as your questions are left unanswered, but that does not affect the spook quotient.<br>

It feels like Hackford (Academy Award nominee for Jamie Foxx-starrer ‘Ray’) and his writer John J McLaughlin (‘Hitchcock’ and ‘Black Swan’) let him down with this middling adaptation of a Donald E Westlake novel.<br>
<br>
His crew has connections is high places, Parker is warned and upon his return is even given hush money to stay away. His girlfriend is threatened and an assassin is sent to kill him.<br>
<br>
Parkers survives, follows them to Palm Beach, Florida in disguise, under an assumed identity and looks around with the help of a desperate real estate agent (JLo) looking for a way out of her deadbeat life.<br>
<br>
It’s stupid that there’s the hint at a love triangle when his character is deeply in love with his girlfriend Claire (something the first half takes goes to great lengths to establish).<br>
<br>
And moreover, it’s tiring to sit through the entirety of this film (two hours too long), annoying to have to put up with an uneven pace and a seriously imbalanced quality of cast. Also, why is a ‘serious’ filmmaker and his writer at the helm of something that’s being marketed as an action film?<br>
<br>
We’ve grown used to seeing Statham in the driver’s seat of a fast-paced action thriller. Something this film, despite pretensions, isn’t. No wonder, he’s taking a backseat here. Come to think of it, all of them are. It’s almost as if they couldn’t care less. Should you?

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>Saleem Sinai, born as India becomes free, is a magical child - will India let its midnight's children remain free?</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Straight away, Midnight's Children (MC) is a love-letter to India. The film takes a difficult novel and mostly does well, producing celluloid that wraps around you like a jamevar shawl. MC opens in pre-Independence Kashmir where Dr. Aziz (Kapoor) is treating Naseem, falling in love even as her father Ghani sahab (Anupam Kher in a superb cameo) prattles on. Kashmiriyat is celebrated in its eccentric beauty and as shikaras glide by a misty Char Chinar, a visual treat unfolds.<br>
<br>
All along, as Aziz's descendants move across India, Pakistan, even dropping into Bangladesh briefly, Salman Rushdie's voice guides you as narrator, blending with Nitin Sawhney's musical score, dipping often into that most fitting raga - Des. It's nicely apt for MC to offer so much in its hearing, Rushdie voicing large ironies with tender little loves, Sawhney's score moving you with its exquisite delights.<br>
<br>
MC also features some striking performances. Roy as Ahmed Sinai presents a passionate portrayal while Bose as General Zulfikar is tightly controlled, whipping at a flock of geese, luxuriating in bubble baths between executing Pakistan's first military coup. Certain performances - Anita Majumdar as talcum-powdered beauty Emerald, Biswas as tortured nurse Mary, Siddharth as cruel Shiva - stand out. Some shots - Saleem's face against a fluttering hand-held fan - are wonderful while some sequences - India's Emergency when daylight itself is imprisoned - dramatic.<br>
<br>
There's occasional staginess and clichés too - turbans, snakes, magicians who don't give it a break - and sometimes, the family drama floods broader political time. The film's length and some performances - Saran and Bhabha - could've been tighter. But mostly, MC moves you with its heart and words, especially when Rushdie murmurs, 'Without passport or permit, in a basket of invisibility, I returned - to my India.'<br>
<br>
You feel the love.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>A seasoned gun-for-hire forms an unlikely alliance with a cop in order to avenge the deaths of their respective partners.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>The name of this film pretty much says it all – action all the way. And Sylvester Stallone and director Walter Hill (known for his action films) have the blueprint down pat when it comes to the A-to-Z of a movie of this kind.<br>
<br>
James Bonomo (Stallone) is a grizzled hitman with a grizzly voice to match who, although thoroughly competent at kicking ass, exhibits a degree of world-weariness. Make no mistake though - he's only just a few gunshots away from busting skulls and spilling guts in the blood-soaked narrative of this film, which is based on a French graphic novel. A series of incidents leads Bonomo to team up with Taylor Kwon (Sung Kang), the archetypical ‘good cop’ who is appalled by his partner’s trigger-happy method of getting rid of the opposition. 'You don't just kill a guy like that,' says Kwon in one scene, to which Bonomo grunts in reply: 'I just did.” Along the way, the duo uncovers a convoluted scam that if nothing else, only gives them license to gleefully blow up more stuff. Keegan (Jason Momoa) is a muscle-bound and menacing villain who stacks up nicely to the task of being a badass.<br>
<br>
The editing is at times a bit too choppy and the fights are often close quarters, crude and bloody. Dialogues in this film are like breaks in between more action scenes. Lisa (Sarah Shahi) plays Bonomo’s estranged but tough daughter who is also attracted to Taylor. Marcus Baptiste (Christian Slater) has a few good lines but this is undoubtedly Sly’s vehicle all the way. Watch it if action films get your adrenaline pumping and you are a Stallone fan.<br>

Out on parole, he tries making a stab at a new life but a piece of paper brands him a dangerous man forever. An act of kindness later, he finds himself paying it forward. However, not before buckets of tears are shed.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>Set in the 19th century, this Tom Hooper adaptation of the Victor Hugo classic merits attention first and foremost for its stellar cast. Each song carries the power of the words the characters utter. When they're angry, you feel the rage, when they're joyous, it's spring and when they're in tears, everything turns a darker shade of dismal grey.<br>
<br>
As Valjean, Jackman plays a variety of parts exceedingly well. He's a convict, he's a factory owner, a mayor, a benefactor, a foster father and a hero. As a foil to the protagonist, Crowe as the persistent prison guard/inspector Javert is annoyingly good. While not as consistent in clarity of dialogue delivery as Jackman, he makes up by playing conflicted soul to the hilt.<br>
<br>
By contrast, Anne Hathaway doesn't leave as much of an impact despite an impassioned (read: weepy) portrayal of the frail, fatalistic Fantine. Amanda Seyfried (as the older Cosette) and Eddie Redmayne (as her suitor, the rebellious Marius Pontmercy) are efficient. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter (the downright evil Thénardiers) bring their quirky brand of menace to the table yet again. Samantha Barks (as Éponine) is a revelation. Her rendition of 'On My Own' is actually more rivetting than Jackman's 'Suddenly'. Watch out for this one, she's gonna go far!<br>
<br>
Top-notch music (Claude-Michel Schönberg), cinematography (Danny Cohen) and production design (Eve Stewart and Anna Lynch-Robinson) add to the experience. To truly enjoy this film, be patient (the length IS an issue), persevere (in spite of the sing-song dialogue) and prevail (the film's actually not as tedious as you'd expect a period historical musical to be).<br>

<strong>Movie Review: </strong>Mayor Hostetler (Russell Crowe) fears he might lose his post to rival candidate Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper). Valliant is hell-bent on exposing Hostetler's alleged real estate scams. Along with political problems, the mayor also faces marital discord. He is convinced but needs proof that will expose his wife's alleged adultery.<br>
<br>
He thus hires Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg), a former cop-turned-private investigator to look into the personal life of his wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones). She however warns Billy that he may be wrong in judging her and her husband's motives.<br>
<br>
Broken City begins brilliantly. The plot keeps you engaged with its twists and turns, making the story look like an action-packed suspense thriller. The build-up is superb. It convinces you to expect an equally gripping second half. Unfortunately, that is where the film runs out of steam and takes up a convenient, clichéd twist which leads to an unappealing climax. The complex web of mysterious events gets unraveled way too easily.<br>
<br>
From a crime thriller to a political drama on corruption, the film also faces identity crisis of sorts. The transition makes you feel as if the director got confused and chose to take an easy way out towards the end. Also, connecting the characters' past to current events seems far-fetched. Some scenes hold no relevance to the story.<br>
<br>
Catherine Zeta-Jones looks the part but is wasted. Wahlberg is seen doing what he probably does in every other film - he indulges in fist-fights when he is not taking pictures. He is good at it but there is nothing new that he does. Russell Crowe has lost weight and plays his part well. The role is half-baked though.<br>
<br>
Broken City had the potential to be this dark crime thriller as it involves dangerous secret investigation and murder. The inclusion of politics makes it pale and predictable. If political dramas are your thing, watch <em>The Ides of March (2011) </em>instead!<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>The sheriff of a sleepy Arizona border town is tasked with stopping a dangerous Mexican cartel boss from returning to Mexico.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>He's back! Ray Owens (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a former LAPD narcotics cop who once tackled toughs on the mean streets of the City of Angels. Now, too old for that kind of action, he has hung up his gloves, put away his shotgun and 'retired' to being sheriff of a small town called Summerton Junction.<br>
<br>
Ray and his deputies Jerry (Zach Gilford), Sarah Torrance (Jaimie Alexander) and Mike (Luis Guzmán) don't have much to do until cartel kingpin Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega) has his toughs visit their town on their way to the border. The scene is then set for the inevitable showdown. The action then shifts away from LA, where FBI Agent John Bannister (Forest Whitaker) has been on Cortez's tail up to that point.<br>
<br>
Summerton's resident redneck goofball Lewis Dinkum (Johnny Knoxville) is a cross between the village idiot and odd-job man, who lovingly hoards a shed full of weapons, each of which he has named after a woman. The fights are meaty, the car chases high-octane and the gunfights, somewhat gory.<br>
<br>
This is a movie without pretensions; a pure action film that Arnold ambles through with absolute ease - perhaps too much so. And not since <em>Commando</em> has he had such an arsenal to nail the bad guys with - he memorably wielded a Gatling minigun in <em>Terminator 2 </em>and here, he has a vintage Vickers machine gun and a pistol the size of a hand cannon to dish out his brand of justice with. Indeed, Arnie sounds so comfortable that his one-liners seem made up on the spur of the moment. Recommended if you enjoy action films.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>In the late 1940s, post-Second World War, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) will have to do what it takes to tackle the expansion of megalomaniacal boxer-turned-gangster Mickey Cohen's crime empire in LA. A group of incorruptible officers are given orders to take down the vicious </em><em>gangster in whichever way possible. The film is inspired by real events.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Honest and fearless, John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) of LAPD is assigned the job of taking down gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn). He is asked to form his own unit, comprising of like-minded, skilled men who can put an end to Mickey's growing crime empire. He thus forms his own 'gangster squad'. The only difference being, his squad will have to violently kill in order to restore order in the city.<br>
<br>
When acting heavy-weights like Sean Penn, Josh Brolin and Ryan Gosling come together, one expects a mind-blowing effect, but that doesn't really happen. <em>Gangster Squad</em> engages and entertains you with its occasional humour, sleek slow-motion action sequences and stylized gun violence but somewhere falls short of substance and depth. As certain righteous cops fight for honour and justice, you do not feel enough for the characters.<br>
<br>
Filmmaker Ruben Fleischer is known for comedy. True to his style, he infuses some good humour in a few scenes. However, in the very next scene, you see extreme bloodshed. The transition doesn't seem too smooth here. That very style worked in his earlier film <em>Zombieland </em>(2009), owing to its genre, which was a comedy.<br>
<br>
Emma Stone as the gangster's moll gets a weak role. Ryan Gosling as the ladies-man seems repetitive. In spite of drawbacks though, the film is high on style and keeps you hooked, thanks to some superb stunts and performances by Josh Brolin and Sean Penn who looks absolutely menacing as Mickey Cohen, his gaze and body language perfect for his character. Brolin is as brilliant as the heroic cop who relentlessly chases Cohen down. As far as stunts are concerned, car chases and fist-fight scenes are superbly shot. The 1940's setting looks authentic too.<br>
<br>
If you like to witness the battle of good versus evil, mafia and mayhem, Gangster Squad has enough fire, guns and bullets to keep you engaged!<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>Former Universal Soldier Luc Deveraux (Van Damme) surfaces in the memories of John (Adkins), a man he leaves in a coma after killing John's wife and daughter for no apparent reason.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>When John wakes up from a coma and starts recovering from the trauma of seeing his wife and daughter shot dead, he tries to piece back his life before his family was murdered. Several threads emerge. There's Magnus, a rampaging handyman (Arlovski), an apparently un-killable Andrew Scott (Lundgren, regenerated as Luc's right-hand man) and a pole-dancer in the fray. They take the story in different directions before John actually finds out more about himself as he makes his way to Luc.<br>
<br>
Hyams shows an assured hand as he directs Van Damme and Lundgren in his second film as a director in this resurrected franchise (the film before this was Universal Soldier: Regeneration). The franchise involves a constant struggle between UniSols (Universal Soldiers, regenerated after being killed in active duty and turned into killing machines) and the government that created them.<br>
<br>
Van Damme turns baddie for the first time in the franchise. His character Luc Deveraux stays the same, but a lot has changed since you last saw him in Regeneration. A terrifying bald 'villain' now, he exudes pure menace. Adkins, a British martial artist, lumbers through this role with required wooden-ness. Arlovski, a former UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) champion shows through his determined, wordless performance why he's called 'The Pitbull'. It's a pity he didn't get more chances to show off his mixed martial arts skills. Lundgren plays a stock role, a re-run of an act he's quite familiar with.<br>
<br>
With at least some scenes that make you cringe over sheer brutality, this film is meant only for those Van Damme fans (and the Unisol franchise) who prefer violent shoot-'em-ups and hand-to-hand combat scenes over stunts and high-octane car chases. One wishes this film had more bite and less bark and growl.<br>

<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> In this film, treasure hunter Chan takes up a job that requires him to deliver the 12 bronze heads of the Chinese Zodiac, pillaged from a former Chinese dynasty's Summer Palace centuries ago. The location of some of these heads is known and Chan and his crew are hired to find the rest and get them to Oliver Platt's character (who plays an unscrupulous auctioneer in the film).<br>
<br>
While on the job, he runs into Coco (Yao), a researcher/activist and Katherine (Weissbecker), a poor lil' rich girl, who's on the verge of bankruptcy. As things are, they've supposedly important parts to play but behave like bumbling fools in the film. Eventually, it's a race against an assorted bunch of pirates, disgruntled security guards and fellow mercenaries that takes this film forward.<br>
<br>
A major grouse against the film is the absence of subtitles in a movie that is in English with a smattering of French and Mandarin (Chinese). Where the film excites with superbly-executed stunts (they never get old, do they?), it also disappoints with a direction-less screenplay (JC's jack-of-all-trades nature to blame?). Recommended solely for those who enjoy Chan's unique brand of humour-laden action with light doses of preachiness and drama, this one could be better, so much better.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>The Impossible is a true story of a family's bravery and endurance in the aftermath of 2004's deadly tsunami.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> An idyllic tropical paradise morphs into a tropical hell from which there seems no exit. Henry (Ewan McGregor), his wife Maria (Naomi Watts) and their three kids, Lucas (Tom Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin) and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast) head out for their Christmas holidays to Thailand and plan to spend a few days soaking in the sun and sea air in <em>Khao Lak </em>- a peaceful and beautiful tropical resort. The morning after Christmas is serene and calm - the proverbial calm before the storm. There is no sense of cinematic build-up or foreboding regarding what is about to happen.<br>
<br>
Then, with almost no warning, the tsunami pounds the land with gargantuan force and ushers in another phase of the film - wherein everything is quite literally turned upside down, shattered and devastated. This abrupt wrenching of gears will get you in the gut. It is relentless and visceral, with the disaster scenes being realistic and intense. Indeed, there is not a wasted second throughout the film, with the battering, surging swells of the ocean matched only by the surge of emotion in some scenes and composer Fernando Velázquez's music.<br>
<br>
The movie gets a bit heavy-handed at times but it can be reasoned that this is Bayona's attempt at telling the story as realistically and graphically as possible by placing the viewer in the centre of it all. By being too focused on the family, there are moments when you might wonder about the thousands of other islanders whose own plight is not touched upon here.<br>
<br>
By themselves, McGregor and Watts are, in a word, fantastic. The kids are very convincing - at times displaying great pluck and courage, heartrendingly vulnerable during other times. In their quest to sift out order from the chaos, they all manage to portray a range of feelings - fear, loss, love and the will to carry on - quite convincingly, without sounding fake or soppy. All in all, it's a powerful ode to the human will to live.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>A lone gunman shoots five random people in what seems like an act of mass murder. Based on evidence and his flawed past, an ex-army sniper is held as the suspect. He wants 'Jack Reacher' (Tom Cruise) to interrogate the case.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>The film is a cinematic adaptation of Lee Child's 2005 novel <em>One Shot</em>. Jack Reacher is Child's successful fictional character from his mystery/thriller novels.<br>
<br>
The film opens with a shooting scene which is disturbing since it reminds you of the current gun violence issue plaguing USA. From the suspect claiming innocence to Reacher getting tangled in the conspiracy crime himself, the 'whodunnit' drama keeps you engaged.<br>
<br>
For those who are unfamiliar with the books, the film does give you a brief backgrounder on Jack Reacher. He's a drifter, an ex-army guy who 'prefers to be left alone' when he's not investigating tough cases. Highly skilled, possessing extreme intelligence, photographic memory and raw strength, he is a man who lives by his own code of honour.<br>
<br>
Does Tom Cruise fit the bill? In the books, Reacher is described as 'big and tall' with ice-blue eyes and dirty blonde hair. Tom Cruise bears no physical resemblance to the character. He does not look intimidating or menacing enough for the goons. Thus, much has been said about Cruise being a misfit for the title role.<br>
<br>
In Cruise's defence, he sheds his movie-star image remarkably, to play the stoic fictional hero who may not be as 'exciting' as his contemporaries. Reacher knows who he is unlike Jason Bourne, does not have fancy cars, clothes and gadgets like Bond, nor is he a wise-cracking, fast-talking guy like Sherlock.<br>
<br>
Cruise, who is otherwise super-expressive as an actor, underplays impressively to portray Reacher. He does justice to the role but on the flipside, you constantly miss Tom Cruise's charisma. Without it, the film borders on being bland in certain portions.<br>
<br>
The villain (played by director Werner Herzog) with his German accent and coloured eyes is creepy. Certain one-liners are impressive while some unintentionally funny.<br>
<br>
Action scenes look authentic. There is no loud background score. The highlight is one of the suspenseful car chase sequences, where Reacher is chasing the bad guys while being chased by the cops. It's been shot brilliantly.<br>
<br>
The film is more of a cerebral drama than a fast-paced, modern action flick. The suspense is satisfying and so is Cruise's 'true to character' performance. A lot depends on whether you like <em>Jack Reacher</em>, the pragmatic investigator.

He wants children to acknowledge his existence. In a desperate urge to be revered, he intends to plant 'fear' in the mind of every child who believes in the beauty of dreams. That is where 'The Guardians' come into the picture.<br>
<br>
Santa Claus, Sandman, Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman) and Jack Frost (Chris Pine) together wage a war against Pitch, Avengers-style, in order to restore 'a sense of wonder' in the lives of children.<br>
<br>
'You are the chosen one for a reason. My centre is to restore wonder to children, what's yours?' asks Santa to Jack Frost. The question is in a way directed to all of us. What makes us truly happy? Every task assigned to us is for a reason and comes with a responsibility.<br>
<br>
The film revolves around the tale of Jack Frost too and, in a way, we all identify with it. His back-story is heartrending. There lies the beauty of the film. It's not just feel-good but heartwarmingly meaningful.<br>
<br>
The film has a message but is not preachy, showing how we should never stop believing in good, no matter what the odds. The film will appeal to all age groups.<br>

The 3D is flawless and adds to the beauty of the film. Voice-overs are impeccable. <em>Rise of the Guardians</em> is a must-watch for the entire family.<br>

	<br>
	<strong>Movie Review:</strong> This movie's a sequel. And I'll be curt here. Don't bother with the first film (<em>The Collector</em>), touted to be a successor of the '<em>Saw'</em> series. Here's a recap of what happened in that film: Arkin, a petty thief, gets trapped in a mansion while picking a safe. A masked murderer enters, tortures and kills everyone inside the house except for Arkin, whom he'collects' in a trunk.<br>
	<br>
	When we meet Arkin in this film, he's in the aforementioned trunk and is set free by Elena Peters (Fitzpatrick), who's one of the revellers at a shady underground club that soon turns into a slaughterhouse, courtesy <em>The Collector</em> (Archer). Arkin manages to escape but is unable to save Elena, who is 'collected'.<br>
	<br>
	As luck would have it, Elena's Daddy Deep-Pockets (McDonald) dispatches right-hand man Lucello (Tergesen) to convince Arkin to lead hired mercenaries to the killer, and promises 'to take care of the rest'. Nothing's ever as simple as that. Arkin is compelled to accompany the group into the killer's lair. Do any of them make it out alive or is it just a suicide mission?<br>
	<br>
	A recap of the previous film would have been ideal but that is sacrificedto keep the movie crisp.<br>
	<br>
	This film has been called many things ('torture porn' being one of them). And if you get queasy at the sight of spilled guts and grey matter, shredded skin and severed body parts and death by impaling, slashing and stabbing, you're probably better off not watching this film. But if you are a fan of the genre, The Collection is worth a watch.</p>

	<strong>Movie Review: </strong>College jock-turned-Marine, Jed Eckert (Chris Hemsworth) takes it upon himself to save his country from the North Koreans' sudden invasion. With no skilled soldiers by his side, he gives his younger brother Matt (Josh Peck) and his college friends a crash course in military training. Within days, the kids who didn't know how to hold a gun, become sharp shooters as they indulge in guerilla warfare against the Koreans. They call themselves '<em>The Wolverines</em>'. Can the unarmed Wolverines protect their town and country from a full-fledged Korean army?<br>
	<br>
	<em>Red Dawn</em> intends to be an inspiring tale of patriotism, bravery and national pride, revolving around a bunch of teenagers. It however looks more like an ambitious action film, made by inexperienced youngsters. The movie looks highly juvenile. The sequence of events defies logic. Poor performances by certain actors who get to play key roles add to the uncalled-for humour.<br>
	<br>
	Josh Peck disappoints the most. He is unable to express the varied emotions his role demands from him. Be it his inner conflict, anger or guilt, Peck is annoying as he ends up overacting in the process. Chris Hemsworth, probably the only 'seasoned' actor, is convincing but the laughable script takes away from his performance. After getting a meaty role in '<em>The Hunger Games</em>', Josh Hutcherson doesn't get to do much. He however plays his standard 'confused teen' role well. Tom Cruise's son Connor gets a significant role and he does impress. The forgettable film will not add much to his portfolio though. The gun-wielding actresses ensure the film looks glamorous.<br>
	<br>
	Red Dawn does offer a few slick action scenes but it lacks substance big time. Everything looks very convenient. You don't feel for the characters.You don't root for them, in spite of them being the underdogs. Romance gets plugged in for no reason and it looks out of place. There is no chemistry between the actors and thus the bonding looks shallow too.<br>
	<br>
	The film is unintentionally funny and this very aspect entertains you the most unfortunately! The film is not slow or dull but it is way too immature for you to like it.</p>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> With his dashing good looks and expertise in soccer, George (Gerard Butler)has a way with women. While almost every second woman throws herself at the former Scottish soccer star, his heart is reserved for ex-wife Stacie (Jessica Biel) only. However, George's bad timing and bad luck when it comes to finances and certain crucial decisions leads to their separation.<br>
<br>
Stacie finds herself a new boyfriend and son Lewis learns to live with the fact that his dad may never be around for him. Hoping for a reconciliation, George decides to get his act right.

Although, as luck or bad luck would have it, he ends up charming the hotshot single mothers of the kids instead! Will Stacie forgive her smokin' hot husband and take him back?<br>
<br>
Playing for Keeps is a decent one-time watch only for the very gorgeous Gerard Butler. The film not only revolves around but also depends solely on his 'sex appeal' and it scores there.<br>
<br>
On the flipside, the rom-com/chick-flick is way too formulaic, clichéd and predictable for your liking. Various women get cozy with George but there is no surprise element as to who gets him. There is no drama or twists andturns to the story. You don't sympathize with poor chick-magnet George. A lack of depth to the characters makes you feel indifferent towards them. The bonding between the father and son is not explored much either.<br>
<br>
Jessica Biel as Stacie is your typical judgemental wife who plays hard to get. She has few dialogues and scenes. Uma Thurman, Dennis Quaid, Judy Greer and Catherine Zeta-Jones have insignificant roles too. Gerard Butler fits the bill as a studly but vulnerable soccer star. He however falls short of evoking emotions in scenes which require that.<br>
<br>
If you don't dig novelty in films and fancy Butler, Playing for Keeps is watchable.

To the untrained eye, this might look like a madhouse with all of monster-dom running amok in a confined space, but nothing is a problem for Dracula. Except for his only child, Mavis (Gomez).<br>
<br>
Her 118th birthday (18th in human years) is just around the corner, she wants to go see the world and is far more optimistic about human nature than her father. In this unholy mix, comes a hitch-hiking human called Jonathan (Samberg). Drac would best have him thrown off the premises but with everyone (the lord of vampires included) taking a shine to the boy, who ends up masquerading as a distant cousin of Frankenstein (James), and Mavis falling for Jonathan, things get complicated.<br>
<br>
The 3D animation is on par with the best in the business. The laughs come, though not thick and fast, and while some gags don't really get the desired 'zing', it is the spirited acting by Sandler and Samberg and the effortlessly fluid animation that sees this film rise above the predictable script. Genndy, the film's director and the name behind cartoons like Dexter's Laboratory and Samurai Jack makes a confident feature debut with this film and guns for nostalgia (and a pining for the old-fashioned life).<br>
<br>
Hotel Transylvania is a feel-good family flick that succeeds in keeping the kids entertained.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>Bella becomes a vampire - and a mum. But the wicked Vultari gang wants to kill baby Renesmee. Will Bella and Edward ever enjoy a happy eternity?</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> So, I never really bit that deep into the whole <em>Twilight</em> hysteria but you can see why it works. Apart from Robert Pattinson's pouty charms as pale-faced vampire Edward Cullen, <em>Twilight</em> features a weirdly wondrous world of vampires and velvet coats, preppie students - werewolves in their spare time - with raging hormones, skin-tight jeans and salon-slick hair, flying in and out of valleys, classrooms and beds. But staying chaste and not biting into the forbidden fruit actually created the tension <em>Twilight</em> was all about.<br>
<br>
That explains the lack of drama in the series finale, <em>Breaking Dawn-Part </em>2. Edward and Bella are finally married, she's a vampire now and they've done 'it' without either getting bitten to death - plus, they have a baby daughter and a home that's floor-waxed bliss - but laden with so much fulfillment, the finale lacks life or zip. The plot features the Cullen family standing about looking adoringly at new bloodsucker Bella shattering tree trunks with her hands, then clustering around her and baby Renesmee as the Vultari gather menacingly.<br>
<br>
The latter have been misinformed that the child is an Immortal - an undying vampire that kills entire communities - and some gory time-travel happens where medieval Vultari fling Immortal babies onto fires, before ripping their mothers' heads off. Renesmee must be protected and all the Cullens' family friends - drunken vampires from Ireland, loincloth-clad Brazilian wonders, water-controlling Turkish-types, even some vintage Euro-trash - join forces.<br>
<br>
There's potential for exciting drama here but <em>Breaking Dawn: Part 2 </em>fades before it even begins, struggling somewhere between the now-fatigued Ed-Bella romance, stagey acting, hilariously hackneyed lines ('You guys look so good together,') and that Stewart clenched-lip grimace. As werewolf Jacob, Lautner tries injecting life and soul into the party - and obligingly takes his shirt off too - but with the rest of the cast really acting like zombies, his efforts don't make much impact. Just like the chill Sheen as villain Aro tries to inject, the Vultari instead resembling an odd bunch that didn't make the grade at Hogwarts and now skulks about sulkily sucking blood.<br>
<br>
<em>Twilight</em> fans will undoubtedly troop the theatres for the finale but it's not a fitting end to such quintessentially American drama, all folklore and fantasy, sexiness and suburbia. As <em>Breaking Dawn-Part 2</em> finally closes, you're left wishing you'd been bitten so much harder.<br>
<br>
Ouch.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>Ralph has been the bad guy in an arcade video game for 30 years too long. Tired of being unloved and unappreciated, despite doing his 'job', he decides to leave and become a hero anyway. Does he succeed in his quest?</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Before one gets down to the actual film, you know you're going to be treated to an animation short. 'Paperman', a black-and-white ode to love-at-first-sight precedes the main feature and must not be missed.<br>
<br>
<em>'Wreck-It Ralph'</em> itself takes you back to an era before gaming consoles were handheld or wireless. For the most part, one had to go to an arcade to play one's favourite games.<br>
<br>
This film takes you behind-the-scenes, as it were, taking a closer look at the characters that peopled those games, right from the eight-bit pixellated beings to the ones that are cutting-edge high-definition wonders.<br>
<br>
Ralph (Reilly) is tired of being the bad guy in a game where everybody takes him for granted and only celebrates the hero Felix (McBrayer), who fixes everything Ralph wrecks with the help of a magic hammer.<br>
<br>
Ralph game-hops to a 'Starship Trooper'-like game called Hero's Duty and eventually lands up in another one called Sugar Rush. His object of attention is a medal he 'wins' in the former game and sort of - loses - in the latter.<br>
<br>
While in Sugar Rush, he meets the feisty and high-strung Vanellope (Silverman), who's branded a glitch but wants nothing more than to win a race and gain her people's respect.<br>
<br>
The film is remarkable in that it takes you on a multi-generational gaming trip, sparking off an aching nostalgia for all things retro while keeping true to its real story - a hero's dilemma - having to choose between doing the so-called right thing and keeping true to your friends.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>Life is groovy for the cats in Hoagy's Alley until the officer in charge of the neighbourhood is replaced by an evil chief of police who is intent on terrorizing everybody in town. It's up to Top Cat and his friends to set things right again.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong><em>Top Cat</em> starts out promisingly with its jaunty theme song and a storyline that is simple enough - Officer Dibble (voiced by Bill Lobley) is removed from his position and replaced by a tech-loving tyrant called Lou Strickland (Jason Harris, who also voices Top Cat).<br>
<br>
As the movie progresses, it soon becomes apparent that the whole thing has been needlessly expanded into a full-length film, because the gags are repeated too often and the pace often plods. For example, Strickland is obsessed with how good he looks, when it's obvious that he looks pretty bad. And yet, this joke is repeated almost two dozen times throughout the film to the point of it becoming annoying.<br>
<br>
As a film for children, this one is avoidable as it would only be a bore due to its length and lack of genuinely good humour. It's only worth a watch if you grew up to Hanna-Barbera cartoons and are extremely curious to see how this modern-day update of the classic series looks on the big screen. Other than for reasons of nostalgia, there are alternatives to check out instead.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>The film is based on the short but rewarding life of Jay Moriarity, ace surfer who rose to fame at the age of 16, for surfing mavericks north of Santa Cruz, Half Moon Bay, California.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the number of moments that take our breath away. This idiom pretty much sums up the life of the late surfer, Jay Moriarity, who died doing what he loved at the young age of 22. What made Jay submit himself to the sea, what was it about surfing that made him give it all? The film showcases ace surfer Jay Moriarity’s life, lessons, struggles, fears, passion, hard work and love for his mentor Frosty Hesson.<br>
<br>
Jay (Jonny Weston) lives with his mother Kristy (Elisabeth Shue). Unable to stick around for too long, Kristy finds herself either jobless or struggling at adjusting to a new workplace. Amidst tackling financial crisis and emotional depression at being dumped by her husband, Kristy finds it difficult to give time to her son Jay.<br>
<br>
From a very early age, Jay learns to be independent out of no choice. Given the circumstances, having seen his mother battle loneliness every single day, Jay matures overnight. He feels older than kids his age. Jay is free-willed but responsible and understanding. With no one to look after him, as a teenager, Jay finds himself a mentor in neighbourhood surfer Frosty Hesson (Gerard Butler). After all, it was Frosty who had saved Jay from drowning as a child. Jay follows Frosty around and discovers he surfs giant waves north of Santa Cruz, in Half Moon Bay, California. Jay convinces Frosty to train him for the same. Conversations with Frosty prove to be life-altering for Jay…<br>
<br>
<em>Chasing Mavericks</em> is a good watch, purely for the subject and not the treatment. It’s an inspiring tale with huge potential of making a mark as a biopic. However, an uninspiring narration restricts the film to good and not excellent. The bland storytelling fails to engage you in scenes where there is no surfing.<br>
<br>
As a film on the life of a surfer, who mastered the adrenalin-driven sport at 16, <em>Chasing Mavericks</em> lacks the emotional pressure that is ideally expected in an athlete-centric film. The dialogues too could have been more effective to compliment the heart-rending story.<br>
<br>
However, in spite of the drawbacks, the film works owing to its brilliant cinematography and heart-warming performances.<br>
<br>
Gerard Butler plays his role well. He looks the part and acts well as the man who is unable to express his true feelings. Unkempt and reserved, he is the prisoner of his own past. Jonny Weston is likeable as Jay Moriarity but lacks charisma.<br>
<br>
If you love the sea and love chasing your dreams, <em>Chasing Mavericks</em> is for you.

"<div class='Normal'><em><strong>Story</strong>: A distraught dad (and a reformed criminal) scours New Orleans in search of his daughter who has been kidnapped by a former partner and friend. A hefty ransom needs to be paid to free the girl and settle scores.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: <em>Stolen </em>is one of those films where, ten minutes in, you can pretty accurately predict how things will pan out. There aren’t many surprises here. This is a formulaic friendship-gone-sour, good-guy-versus-bad-guy story set in New Orleans, with a kidnap being the premise of the entire film and car chases thrown in.<br>
<br>
Will Montgomery (Nicolas Cage) is an expert bank robber who has some quirky superstitions. For good luck, he listens to Creedence Clearwater Revival before every ‘job’. He attempts one final robbery along with longtime partners Vincent (Josh Lucas), Riley Jeffers (Malin Akerman) and their foul-mouthed getaway driver Hoyt (M.C. Gainey). Things go wrong at the last minute however, and Will winds up in the slammer for eight years. During that time, his pals put their days of robbing banks behind them. Vincent however, re-emerges as the villain, but ends up looking more like a broke hippie with a nasty hangover. And he has a few bones to pick with Montgomery.<br>
<br>
The film has its moments. The cop on Montgomery's tail, Tim Harlend (Danny Huston) spews some funny one-liners and New Orleans is interestingly portrayed. The film does move along at a brisk pace, but in the process, it doesn’t really get under the skin of each character. While it seems that Nicolas Cage left Las Vegas a long time ago, you will get the feeling that he seems to be borrowing stylistic elements from his own past movies. Give it a shot only if you’re a hardcore Cage fan.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>A cranky old baseball scout is forced to face his daughter, past regrets on what could be his last assignments… </em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Gus Lobel (Clint Eastwood) has been one of the best Baseball scouts around for a long time. His experienced judgement is however doubted by a younger sports manager who believes mathematical statistics are more important than understanding of the game and the player. Gus is given one last chance to prove his mettle and that he still has it in him. Gus’ estranged daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) decides to accompany him on his last recruiting assignment. The two end up ‘talking’ for a change,venting the anger, bottled up emotions and unspoken words.<br>
<br>
True to Eastwood’s style, Trouble with the Curve is purely an emotional human drama, revolving around buried emotions. The pace is slow but that doesn’t matter as the father-daughter strained relationship touches your heart. You can identify with their dilemmas, rapport, and reservations.<br>
<br>
Their issues are as realistic as they can get. An aloof father who’s super protective of his daughter, daughter joining her father on his last trip, keeping aside their past only to save his job..Trouble with the Curve is a film which every father should watch with his daughter.<br>
<br>
Justin Timberlake plays an unimportant role but is impressive. The film belongs to Amy Adams. The actress is brilliant as the girl dealing with a constant fear of losing the people she loves. Clint Eastwood is good as ever.<br>
<br>
No significant events happen in the film, it’s about how you deal with situations when life happens to you. It’s a simple story, brilliantly told.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>The film is an ambitious portrayal of how the actions of people – be it good or bad- have a ripple effect on the lives of others, regardless of whether events occur in the past, present or future.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> To say that<em> Cloud Atlas</em> is ambitious in its scope would be an understatement. The Wachowskis have always tried to inspire awe amongst viewers with genre-bending movies that feature a tantalising mix of both spectacle and substance. But does it work?<br>
<br>
To begin with, all of the top billing cast members play six different characters (the film is divided into six stories) with plenty of ‘wow’ moments thrown in. Indeed, you will get to see the all-star cast play everything from rum-chugging pirates to warriors in a post-apocalyptic future. In fact, one of the most amazing things about Atlas is the excellent makeup effects.<br>
<br>
The film itself is set in various different time periods (period pieces set in the mid-1800s and 1930s, a conspiracy thriller in the 1970s, a modern quirky comedy, two science fiction fables in the future and so on) and each character’s story is marvelously fleshed out, both literally and figuratively. Investigations on evil industrialists, sci-fi villains, car chases, battles with sub-human people – its all happening here.<br>
<br>
The vignettes start off as seemingly disparate stories but as matters progress, the connection between each story and indeed, all of the characters fall into place, like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. It’s also pretty apparent that karma and déjà vu play a big part in Atlas. This is because the whole cause-and-effect theory is used conveniently as the conceptual glue which holds this entire juggernaut of a movie together. It’s also intelligently made: while the first half of the movie’s stories progress forward, the second half goes somewhat backwards in history. There is some deadweight here.<br>
<br>
There are a few brief scenes that seem redundant. But what keeps this kaleidoscope of stories from becoming a glorified hodgepodge is clear, simple narration of what are essentially, several love stories. By the time the movie ends, you won’t be left wondering about the message behind the movie.<br>

	<strong>Movie Review:</strong> You know that kid nobody wants to be friends with? Well, John Bennett is one such kid who finds acceptance in a stuffed teddy bear gifted to him by his parents at Christmas. One night, he wishes he could talk to the bear, who he unimaginatively names Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane). The next morning, Ted comes to life and weeks later, makes his run of the talk shows and he becomes something of a minor celebrity as the years wear on. But, as the narrator (voiced by Patrick Stewart) notes, 'No matter how big a splash you make in this world, whether you're Corey Feldman, Frankie Muniz, Justin Bieber or a talking teddy bear, eventually nobody gives a sh**.'<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>If you have seen even one of the four ‘Paranormal Activity’ films that have been made so far, you have seen them all.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>After the first film came out in 2007, the sequels have been nothing but remakes of the original with diminishing scary moments. The first and even second installment worked as a ‘found footage’ horror film but post that, the franchise hasn’t been able to modify in order to keep the audiences hooked, owing to its repetitive storylines, spooky events and pretty much everything else.<br>
<br>
<em>Paranormal Activity 4 </em>takes off where the 2nd installment ended. You get to see a recap in case you haven’t seen the 2nd film. The recap shows Katie (Katie Featherston, common face in all Paranormal series) carrying her toddler nephew Hunter, the only survivor of her family, to an undisclosed location in the middle of the night, dressed in blood-stained clothes. Her whereabouts are not known. Years later, another family starts experiencing supernatural occurrences in their house after they allow their neighbour’s kid Robbie (Brady Allen) to stay with them for a couple of days.<br>
<br>
Fifteen-year-old Alex (Kathryn Newton) senses the happenings could be more than illusions and decides to secretly capture her house on camera with the help of her tech savvy beau Ben (Matt Shively). That is when the events start to unravel and you get to see the typical Night #1, #2… happenings, Paranormal style.<br>
<br>
All the Paranormal series have taken a considerable amount of time to build up the suspense. The slow and steady beginning didn’t disappoint as the spooky climax made up for the sluggish start. <em>Paranormal 4</em> fails when it comes to delivering what’s expected. It drags way too much and when it does attempt to frighten you, its way too late and way too less.<br>
<br>
No activity happens in the house almost throughout the movie except for Alex video-chatting with Ben. Alex hearing weird noises in the house, chairs shifting, doors opening and closing mysteriously, kids blankly staring at the tv…except for these routine events, you don’t get anything that sends a shiver down your spine. Barring Katie Featherston who does a good job, everyone else acts caricaturish. If you love horror as a genre, this one is hugely disappointing.<br>
<br>
The handycam-style cinematography is not easy on the eyes as usual and the lack of spooky elements only worsens the experience. The buzzing background score works but nothing about <em>Paranormal Activity 4</em> truly scares you. It’s the weakest one in the series so far. Hope the franchise isn’t making its 5th film already...
