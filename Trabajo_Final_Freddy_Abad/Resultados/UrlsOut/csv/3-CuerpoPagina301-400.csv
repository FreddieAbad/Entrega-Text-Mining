"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>There’s no rest for the wicked, as the saying goes. But Arthur Bishop (Statham) is anything but wicked; a rebel with a cause, more likely. And Bishop’s arch-nemesis Crain (Hazeldine) has taken his girlfriend Gina (Alba) hostage. Crain tells Bishop that he will execute Gina unless and until he carries out a bunch of ‘hits’ (read: murders) for him. Dirty deeds done dirt cheap. But in this case, for love. Bishop has to comply. As fate deals it, Crain finds out that he has made a double-handed deal with the Devil himself.<br>

<strong>Review: </strong>Move over, Jackie Chan. Head to the back of the class, Matt Damon’s – now, honestly very yawn-inducing – Jason Bourne. Sylvester Stallone and Arnie, you are both legends and you both finally have a worthy successor. Pure action films, in this case revenge-action as a sub-genre, as this kind of movie is meant to be straightforward and to be digested by anyone whether they are ten years old or 50. Jason Statham is now the DUDE of unabashed, no-holds-barred action films. Despite the staid title like ‘mechanic’ and a plot line that is as simple as can be, Statham pulls punches – literally – like we haven’t seen in any action film this year. Okay, to be fair, at least not yet.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> An Aussie teacher Will (Brett Lee) falls in love with an Indian woman, Meera (Tannishtha Chatterjee), a single mother based in Sydney. But given their cultural differences and Meera's past, can her family accept this 'UnIndian' match?<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Anupam Sharma's romcom is a refreshing take on cross-cultural relationships in contemporary times. The film doesn't succumb to clichés. It is nothing like Gurinder Chadha's standard musical chick-flick with an overdose of Punjabi tadka, predominantly catering to the Indian diaspora and that is its victory. Though it has the usual characters — a ‘groom seeking’ Indian mom (Supriya Pathak, funny) and a conservative Indian father (Akash Khurana, effective), the situations are far more real and thus, relatable. There are noaloo gobi jokes either. Meera isn't seeking a wealthy Indian man settled in Australia, nor is Brett Lee a professional cricketer in the film.<br>

<strong>Review: </strong>A quick lookup of this movie might label it to be a comedy. However, it is anything but that. If there is any humour in this, it is a brand of dark humour that is played upon with a light touch, thanks to the director’s and screenwriters’ vision. And of course, Teller and Hill, who both excel in their roles.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>STORY:</strong> A live-action reboot of the original 1977 film (also by Disney), the film revolves around an orphaned boy Pete (Oakes Fegley), and his fascinating friendship with the gigantic green dragon, who he names Elliot.<br>
<br>
<strong>REVIEW: </strong>Elliot finds little Pete stranded in the woods, after he survives a car crash that kills his parents. On encountering the mammoth green creature, Pete innocently asks him, “Are you gonna eat me?” Elliot doesn’t. He (literally) takes the boy under his wing. The two strike up an unlikely friendship and stay inseparable for six years, until forest rangers and loggers stumble upon their whereabouts. While the dragon can go invisible, Pete cannot. Do they manage to stay together in the deep forest, in the world of their own; they had so fondly created, away from the human menace?<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>The classic tale of Ben Hur (Huston) who is turned upon by his adopted brother Messala Severus (Kebbell) gets a modern-day retelling. Messala is a high ranking officer in the Roman Army while Ben Hur is an aristocrat. Their friendship gets soured and Messala falsely accuses Ben Hur of a crime that he did not commit. With everything taken away from him, Ben Hur must find the right path in life.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>First off, it must be said that this film cannot and will not hope to replace the 1959 one that had Charlton Heston play the titular character. That movie, stretched over almost four hours was epic in every sense. But Huston does do a pretty decent job of essaying the role of Ben Hur with a degree of conviction. Kebbell’s Messala is suitably nasty, as he treacherously turns upon Ben Hur, motivated by silly and petty reasons.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>A group of criminals – the Suicide Squad – are recruited by the US government to rid the world of an otherworldly menace that can, and will destroy humanity if allowed to run unchecked. True to their nature of being anti-heroes though, they nonetheless are rebels with a cause, all motivated by a sliver of goodness that still shines deep inside despite dark past histories. They are a motley crew, but when all else fails, it is only the Squad that can get the job – whatever it may be – done.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Suicide Squad has all the ingredients that are collectively essential to a superhero film. Action, witty dialogues delivered at the best of times and lots of special effects thrown in as well. But what this gang of delightfully crazy rogues offer is something subversive, a disregard for any pretense of doing something noble, and yet, they are all motivated by a simple desire to just get a chance at living a normal life again. Away from prison cells and maximum security establishments.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> With Jason Bourne, Matt Damon reprises his most celebrated screen character for the fourth time after a gap of nine years! Watching him dodge the hitmen with his lightening reflexes and ruthless killing abilities once again, is a sheer delight. His quiet charm and understated aura reminds us why it’s hard for other actors (read Jeremy Renner) to step into his shoes as far as the Bourne franchise is concerned.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Despite the title, and much like the original, this film doesn’t even pretend to be even anything remotely spooky. Instead, it comes across more as a nearly two-hour long joke reel that never takes itself too seriously. Devoted fans of the old film will no doubt look to compare almost every frame, but this film is best enjoyed as being seen as a standalone. Sure, there are quite a few cameos to delight diehards of Ivan Reitman’s flick. But they aren’t really all that consequential to the plot.<br>

Unlike the other monstrous giants, BFG does not eat 'human beans' (read human beings). The two lonely souls bond over their mutual liking for adventures and form an unexpected friendship. But can Sophie be safe in the Giant Country?<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> In BFG's lingo, if I were to describe my first thoughts on watching this beautiful fairytale, I'd say, 'I IS HAPPY'. Steven Spielberg, the master storyteller weaves his magic once again and transports you to a world of fantasy that pleases the child in you. An enchanting tale on a chance companionship between an unlikely pairing has never been so riveting.<br>

While growing up, she was never really sure of what was and wasn’t real when the lights went out… And now her little brother, Martin (Bateman), is experiencing the same unexplained and terrifying events that had once tested her sanity and threatened her safety. A frightening entity with a mysterious attachment to their mother, Sophie (Bello), has reemerged. But this time, as Rebecca gets closer to unlocking the truth, there is no denying that all their lives are in danger… once the lights go out.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> This film continues the new trend of horror films going away from the tried and tested found footage and haunted house tropes. What we have here is subtle, psychological horror that does not rely on jump scares but rather, horror with more finesse, if that can be said. Think about Babadook, a low budget Australian horror flick that is on every list of ‘best ofs’ in this genre.<br>
<br>
So, without giving away the plot, obviously, what we have on our hands is a brooding and doom-laden tale of a family in strife. A conflict-torn mother coping with a sense of loss, a son who is wise beyond his years (yes, shades of The Ring are also present) who is protective of his mother and everything shrouded in a grey, doom-laden cloak of colours.<br>

<strong>Review:</strong> While Star Trek Beyond is chock-full of relentless action sequences (the first one, barely ten minutes into the film) and breathtaking space scenes, Lin and the writers of this film have taken things beyond just making stuff blow up in a dramatic fashion.

<strong>Review: </strong>To start with, there is the prologue involving Scrat (but of course as no Ice Age movie would be complete without him) and his desperate efforts to safeguard his food source. But then again, it’s like a never-ending effort as no matter how hard he tries, the nut only stays in his grasp for a few seconds. It’s a delight to watch him.<br>

	<strong>Review:</strong> Created from the same animation film production company (Illumination Entertainment) that gave us Despicable Me, Pets is makes us privy to the adorable, mischievous and sprightly (in that order) activities of a bunch of animals whose owners are obviously and blissfully clueless about their shenanigans. Co-directors Chris and Yarrow introduce us to a slew of characters, well rendered and ranking high on the cuteness scale without coming across as saccharine sweet. In fact, it can easily be said that the best part about this fast-paced film is the quality of the animation.<br>

<strong>Review:</strong> Matthew McConaughey's Newton Knight is one controversial figure. But in this film, he remains singularly uni-dimensional. The scenario is superficial and jarringly too good to be true. But the spirited drama does its best to make amends by filling the plot with clap-traps (which can be called uplifting at places). The historical connect commands your interest for some time, but the clinical treatment of the plot can put you off. The film lacks a sense of drama and urgency, keeping the tone flat for its entire runtime.<br>

<br><br>

	<strong>Review: </strong>Well, unlike the insipid earlier edition, there is a genuine effort to create a coherent story this time around. To say that this one is notches above its dull predecessor on every count is not overplaying the praise. There is a marked improvement in the writing, even if it isn't consistent. You can't miss the fact that the screenplay's focus remains on the titular characters and their pathos, despite the constant tug to orchestrate lofty action pieces. The Ninja Turtles stand out as individual characters with distinct personalities, each of whom have their own share of pain to deal with. Their inferiority complex and desire to be acknowledged helps play the emotional card with great subtlety.

<strong>REVIEW:</strong> Reminiscent of the Coen Brothers, Shane Black’s The Nice Guys is a twisted concoction of genres. It’s a neo-noir mystery cum buddy cop action comedy that startles you with its unpredictable crime plot laced with deadpan humour. Black turns his dashing duo into clumsy buffoons, who seem to be anything but ‘nice’. These are two people, who are not meant to be together, but it’s their skills - Healy’s punches and March’s analytical bent of mind – that draws them closer. While the leading duo (Gosling in particular), owns the film, it’s the quirky writing that sets it apart. Neither the characters, nor the sequences set out to be funny; they just end up being one.<br>

But in doing so, will the original experiment – that of foiling a plot to create a wormhole program that would allow a programmer to bypass all computer codes protecting the world's nuclear defense codes – be successful?<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> It is worth noting that Costner, Oldman and Jones have teamed up for the second time since 1991’s JFK. But while that movie involved an intricate web of intrigue and investigation, this one seeks to go into a brand new direction. Ambitious, not a doubt, for it is quite interesting and often amusing to see an old lug like Kevin Costner wrestle with what is essentially a split personality that he has been somewhat forcefully subjected to.<br>

<strong>Review: </strong>Jodie Foster has crafted a careful and wary indictment of capitalism that seems a few years dated here.

<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Right from the outset, this film goes for the mainline in terms of making an emotional connection with the audience. A lot of time is devoted to depicting Pele’s childhood (born Edson Arantes Do Nascimento and nicknamed Dico by his parents, he is in the film played by Carvalho and de Paula at various stages of his youth) and his passion for the game. Indeed, he was so poor that even purchasing a football was out of his financial reach. But that would not stop him from realizing his dream. Indeed, after Brazil’s devastating loss in the 1950 World Cup final, a saddened nine-year-old Dico makes the bold and unlikely promise to his father that someday he will go on to win a World Cup for Brazil.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Watching this film is like time travelling back into the past – 14 years to be precise. For one, you might wonder why there was such a long gap in between films and secondly, you might find yourself wondering just what the reason was for this film to be made at all.<br>

An extremely astute and intelligent director who has a penchant for both mega-buck blockbusters (Star Trek, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Mission: Impossible III) as well as flicks with relatively smaller budgets (Super 8, co-produced by Steven Spielberg) but still pack a hefty punch in terms of cerebral cool. Combined with Trachtenberg, who helms this one, they’ve created a film that is delightfully unpredictable and extremely original.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Srinivasa Ramanujan had the extraordinary ability to conjure up very complex and groundbreaking mathematical concepts seemingly out of thin air. And all of that, despite not having any formal training in the subject. He hailed from a humble background, and was nurtured and mentored to greatness by another brilliant mathematician, G H Hardy. This is Ramanujan’s story.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> The biggest challenge Matthew Brown could have faced when making this film might have been making math look interesting enough on screen to keep viewers hooked. But he manages to do so, thanks to Patel’s fairly straightforward portrayal of the brilliant Ramanujan. That, and the stately Jeremy Irons, who gives Hardy oodles of wit and panache. In fact, more than just a staid version one man’s life, The Man Who Knew Infinity is also about the meeting of two minds – Hardy and Ramanujan.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Mother’s Day sees a small group of unconnected people try to mend relationships with their respective mothers and daughters. Sandy (Anniston) tries to be a better mom to her kids after her divorce from Henry (Olyphant). Successful writer Miranda (Roberts) is estranged from her daughter Kristin (Robertson). And free-spirited Jesse (Hudson) tries to reconnect with her own mother.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> It’s a bit surprising to see a director like Garry Marshall, who has a resume that dates way back to the 60s, now immerse himself in this kind of confection (literally, for the number of doughnuts, desserts and M&M candy references you’ll see in this movie), which strives to make you sentimental about your mother, with an overloaded cast of characters, for two hours.<br>

Before they face each other off though, Freya must deal with two renegade warriors of hers, Eric the Huntsman (Hemsworth) and Sara (Chastain) who have fallen in love with each other.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> A combination of Hemsworth, Theron and Chastain would seem like a fairly powerful cast line-up. But in this case, their collective talents seem to be a tad squandered on something that parades as great visual candy (read: costumes and scenery) some special effects (but of course, as a film like this would ride on that) but not very much else.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Jessie (Bosworth), Mark (Jane) and their little boy Sean made for a happy family until their son dies in a tragic accident at home. The couple then adopts a new foster child, Cody (Tremblay), in an attempt to rebuild their lives. However, their foster kid harbours a terrible and sinister secret that mixes the psychological with the supernatural. Cody's dreams manifest into reality. And this can be both a good and a bad thing. Both good dreams and bad have their effect in equal measure.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Before I Wake has an incredible premise, full of promise and grist for the horror fan to chew on. Think of it – a kid whose dreams become reality much to the betterment or detriment of those around him. And that could mean absolutely any dream. Be it about butterflies (an oft-repeated motif in the film) or a ghoul that looks like he escaped from the reality-horror videogame Dead Space 2.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> An investment banker named Davis Mitchell (Gyllenhaal) has everything one in his field might hope to have. Success, a home that’s picture perfect and the trophy wife. In a twist of fate, she passes away in a tragic accident and in the aftermath, Davis loses it. He pens a bizarre complaint letter to a vending machine company, for instance. But amidst all the mess, a sliver of salvation begins to bloom for him, when he forms an unlikely connection with Karen (Watts), a customer service agent. But in order to progress, he must first demolish all edifices of the past.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Jake Gyllenhaal seems to have a penchant for playing characters that are damaged, yet wily and with a strong sense of self-assurance. Nightcrawler was a prime example of that and now, to a lesser extent, Demolition sees him stepping into the quirky role of Davis’ character. And what a character he is. Intense, yet not without a sense of self-irony and humour, bordering on parody.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Rudyard Kipling’s classic tale of a young boy brought up in the jungle by various animals is brought to life once again on the big screen in a fittingly wonderful way. Mowgli leads a peaceful and happy life with a wolf pack led by Akela (Esposito) and Raksha (Nyong’o) until the tiger Shere Khan (Elba) enters the scene, bearing an old grudge and an insatiable desire for revenge.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> If you go to the cinema to watch a movie that will draw you into a fantasy world of wonder, Favreau’s retelling of this story – which so many of us remember from childhood – manages to weave that magic. We all know how the story plays out. With the panther Bagheera’s (Kingsley) help, Mowgli (Sethi) tries to stay away from Shere Khan. He also encounters the devious python Kaa (Johansson), a super-sized orangutan with a soul-singer’s baritone named King Louie (Walken) desperate to obtain the ‘red flower’( which is fire) and of course, Baloo the grizzly bear (Murray). These are the key characters, but you’ll also be delighted to discover a few new entrants along the way as well. It all builds on the charm of the 1967 film, which by itself is a must watch for any child.<br>

<strong>Review: </strong>Kung Fu Panda 3 by and large hits the right notes by serving up everything that fans of this franchise have loved, while adding some new elements too. And it’s all buoyed up with a fun storyline.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Continuing where Insurgent left off, Allegiant sees Tris (Woodley) making a break from Chicago along with Four (James) and friends to try and find out the truth behind their lives as well as the real story about the factions. The truth however, might not be all that Tris had bargained for.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> While the previous film in this series set the stage for a hopefully interesting follow up, Allegiant turns out to be a bit of a letdown. Diehard fans might also find this movie a stretch or rather, a two hour stretch of a film that gets cheesier every ten minutes or so. The resultant product is something that isn’t quite unlike a B-movie where everything from the costumes and character styling (incidentally, how did Tris’ hair grow out so soon?) to the weapons (which look like they’re put together by a 10-year-old) to their dialogues, will make you cringe.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> While Superman’s actions are undoubtedly heroic, Batman begins to feel that if Superman isn’t made to deal with his own mortality and put in his place, he will assume himself to be a god, an authority unto himself. As the action in Metropolis unfolds and these two icons of the superhero universe battle it out, Superman’s nemesis Lex Luthor creates a monster called Doomsday to destroy Metropolis. It’s only Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman who have a chance at stopping Luthor and Doomsday.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>It’s important to know that while all the usual elements of a superhero flick are in place, this is a somewhat different kind of superhero film. It's also pretty dark (given that the Dark Knight series and Man of Steel were intense enough by themselves), and gradually builds up to a climactic conclusion.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Colonel Catherine Powell (Mirren) heads an operation to kill a group of terrorists in strife-ridden Kenya. The operation however, involves no boots on the ground. It’s carried out via a drone and a well-placed Hellfire missile. Matters get complicated when a girl strays in the target area to sell bread. Apart from drone pilot Steve Watts (Paul) refusing to fire, the matter quickly escalates into an international dispute over the right course of action. Do they carry out the strike and risk killing the girl?<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Eye In The Sky is a gripping examination of the protocols behind drone warfare. These battles however, play out like a video game, with pilots sitting in a dark room filled with display screens a continent away, moving a joystick. However, drone warfare is as rule-driven – or at least it is made out to be – as ever. Guidelines of engagement have to be adhered to and collateral damage has to ideally be zero. And the collateral damage angle forms the backbone of this movie.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Luke Vaughn (Morgan) doesn’t have the cash to pay for the cancer treatment that his little daughter has to undergo. And being a devoted dad, he is willing to go the distance in order to get the funds. This means teaming up with Cox (Bautista) to rob a casino owned by Pope (De Niro) that he used to work in. But predictably enough, things go awry and they have to hijack a bus in order to make their getaway from both a team of cops, led by Officer Kris (Carano) and Pope.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Bus 657 (also titled as Heist in some countries) is a fairly fast paced cat-and-mouse chase involving the said casino thieves trying to outrun both the mob as well as the cops, who are in hot pursuit. Played out mostly on a bus containing a motley crew of hostages, the entire premise of the film is itself telegraphed early on, before the chase begins, and you do get an inkling of how most of the film will play out.<br>

<strong>Review: </strong>If there’s one thing that this film proves really well, it is that apart from being able to ride a bike really well, Armstrong (Foster, quite on point) also managed to perfect the dubious art of being a liar and a scam artist.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> It is 1936 and the world is slowly heading towards the brink of yet another global conflagration. Hitler however, is still three years away from invading Poland. But US track athlete Jesse Owens faces a different kind of hurdle apart from winning multiple track races the 1936 Berlin Olympics – that of racial prejudice.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Although the wordplay behind the title of this film is clever – the Olympics race as well as the racial discrimination Owens (James) faces in both the US and Germany – this is by and large, quite a no-nonsense movie about a legendary athlete. While scant mention is made of his life after the Olympics win, Owens is portrayed as a squeaky clean guy whose single aim in life was to win big at the Olympics. And of course, win he did. Two men are key figures in getting him to Berlin. Olympic Committee chief Avery Brundage (Irons) negotiates not only with the Olympics Committee to get the USA to participate in the Olympics despite the Nazis’ anti-Jew activities and racist ideologies, but also with Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels (Metschurat) to tone down the anti-Semitism or else the event would be boycotted by the USA. Then there’s Ohio State coach Larry Snyder (Sudeikis, in fine form) who himself missed his shot at the Olympics in the past. Snyder trains and mentors Owens but in time, the two strike up an enduring and easy friendship.<br>

<strong>Review: </strong>Hillcoat goes all out in his attempt to depict a city apparently rife with crime, where even the good guys cannot be trusted. Grimy realism, visceral action and even the proverbial gum-chewing, unshaven cop who speaks little but packs a big punch; it’s all in here. Oh, and add to that more ingredients, such as the Russian mafia (Winslet plays henchwoman Irina admirably), a soundtrack that’s good enough to listen to on its own, good cinematography, courtesy Nicolas Karakatsanis and an effective screenplay by newbie Matt Cook.<br>

And if so, wouldn’t it be a terrible feeling for a person to realize that their husband or wife has never really stopped loving someone – even if that someone is long dead?<br>

<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Is that really Leo? It’s a question you might ask yourself about a half hour or so into this movie. And probably several times after that. Because DiCaprio’s greatest achievement in The Revenant is that he makes you forget that it is him you’re watching on screen. His degree of character immersion – bearded, bloodied, bruised and more – has arguably never been better.<br>

<strong>Review: </strong>A lot of us would have come across stock photography in some form or another in our day-to-day lives.

The Coast Guard send out some of their bravest men on an almost impossible rescue attempt.<br>

<strong>Review:</strong> The plot of this film is fairly straightforward by itself. While seasoned seamen are stranded in the gale, staring death in the face, it’s a miracle that they’re still alive and that the shattered Pendleton is even afloat. It’s only able crewman Ray’s (Affleck) resourcefulness that has kept them from death. Daniel Cluff (Bana) is Coast Guard sailor Bernie Webber’s (Pine) Warrant Officer.<br>
