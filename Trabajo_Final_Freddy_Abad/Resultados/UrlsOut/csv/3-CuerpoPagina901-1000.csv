"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> It may be just another year in Tom (Jim Broadbent) and Gerri's (Ruth Sheen) life but for the old and happily married couple, it turns out to be an eventful year when friends and family cope with the problems of ageing, loneliness and impending gloom. The changing seasons find their reflection in the changing moods of their friend Mary (Leslie Manville) who still harbours hopes for a new beginning, despite the onrush of age and isolation.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> There is nobody who understands family better than Mike Leigh. If you thought Secret and Lies was one of the most touching family portraits you had seen on screen, then do take a look at Another Year.<br>
<br>
The film is a gentle yet stark dissection of relationships in a society that doesn't have much to offer to the older, wiser generation of people who are being left out, sidelined, shelved. Of course, at centre-stage, there is the happily married couple, Tom and Gerri who keep an open home for friends and family. But they stand out as oddballs amongst all the dysfunctional people who visit their home. Case in point being the desperate, drunk and going-downhill Mary who mistakenly believes a car will be the solution to all her problems. Or else, the female patient (Staunton) who visits a doctor because she can't sleep and rates her happiness quotient as one out of 10.<br>
<br>
Watch the film for its compelling performances, specially by Leslie Manville, who is absolutely brilliant as the sad yet strong and self-respecting Mary.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> The Green Hornet is a fictional super hero who made his debut in American pulp fiction through a radio series during the 1930s. Playboy Britt Reid (Seth Rogen) inherits his father's media empire and chooses to re-vamp hisnewspaper, The Daily Sentinel, by creating the headlines himself. He dons the vigilante's role and plays a crusader by night with his driver and coffee-maker, Kato (Jay Chou) who happens to be a martial arts experts and a wizard with gadgets.<br>
<br>
But, being somewhat of a dimwit, Britt needs his smart assistant (Cameron Diaz) to lay down the plan of action for the super hero act. Will the Green Hornet and his side-kick save the city from crime lord Chudnofsky (Christopher Waltz)?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The Green Hornet isn't any ordinary super hero story. This one is a complete revision of the vigilante's tale of valour. And the fact that it does it with comedy and flair makes it such a fun watch.<br>
<br>
When a bored Britt chooses to spice up his life by playing a super hero at night, he asks his coffee-maker cum driver, Kato to point out what's common between all super heroes. The cape, the tights, proffers Kato. Nah! The fact that they are all the good guys, says Britt. Hence the new plan: We will pose as villains and act like heroes, he exults and sets out to create mayhem in a city that is in the stranglehold of another joker: the boring bad guy with the hard-to-pronouce name, Chudnofsky.<br>
<br>
The film is a roller-coaster ride from the opening shot itself. Seth Rogen's bumbling super hero act is a complete laugh riot. I'm the guy who gets to shoot fart guns, while others have gun-guns, he laments when his assistant gives him his new weapon of destruction, a gas gun. Jay Chou's Kato is enigmatic and endearing, specially when he doggedly refuses to be labelled as the sidekick and is not ready to be the `Doo' to Rogen's `Scooby' act. And Cameron Diaz is the sassy assistant who unknowingly scripts the super hero mayhem that explodes in Los Angeles.<br>
<br>
Witty dialogues, bumbling heroes, zany bad guys, high-voltage action, The Green Hornet is a fun make-over of the super hero movie. Don't miss it.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Holly (Katherine Heigl) and Messer (Josh Duhamel) are the oddest couple in town. Their first date ends in a disaster but destiny brings them together again. This time as foster parents to the infant Sophie who loses her parents in an accident. Will the mismatched duo manage to strike the right note after slugging it out for so long?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> This one's a breezy romcom which takes its time to strike the predictable happily-ever-after note. But it carries you along in its languorous cruise through the highs and lows of this couple that reluctantly tries to build a home, after circumstances force them to live together. Holding the film together is the crackling chemistry between Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel who actually make an interesting, made-for-each-other couple, without their knowing so.<br>
<br>
Of course, they spend most of the screen time sparring with each other since both of them have different goals. Holly, the more pragmatic one, wants to set up her own restaurant while Messer, the hedonist, believes in fun and games alone. He'd like to be left alone picking up hotties in the local grocery store or covering the games as a TV producer. But when the two come together to try their hand at clumsy parenting, they are perfectly in sync, changing messy diapers, singing strange lullabies and stumbling through the new responsibility that has been thrust on them.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> This is a biopic on the traumatic life of Valerie Plame, a CIA operative who had to lose her cover after being exposed by the White House when her husband, ambassador Joe Wilson wrote an expose in the newspapers. Wilson alleged that President George W. Bush manipulated intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in order to justify the US invasion of Iraq.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The film uses a real life controversy to end up as a powerful indictment of the Bush administration and its war against terror. Valerie Plame, a gutsy CIA officer assigned to gather intelligence on Iraq, had to give up her job and run for cover after her identity was exposed by senior US officials in the White House. This was a retaliation against her husband, a US ambassador who wrote an article stating that US had no case against Iraq, since there had been no uranium exports from Niger to Iraq to facilitate their nuclear weapons programme. No yellow cake, no aluminium pipes, hence no weapons of mass destructions: the Bush administration had got it all wrong when it came to Iraq and its role in terrorism.<br>
<br>
Naturally, the backlash from the White House was too intense and almost swept away the vulnerable couple, their home and their marriage. Acquaintances of Plame in the CIA have reminisced about how the real life Valerie became `a leper...almost radioactive,' after the expose. Naomi Watt's brings out Plame's pain and anguish with grandeur and dignity. She deftly juxtaposes her sundry roles as wife, mother and high-profile secret agent and brings to life a memorable character. Sean Penn's delineation of Ambassador Wilson brims over with bluster and verve. As the lone voice of conscience in the cacophony of aggressive nationalism, Penn paints a picture of fortitude and courage.<br>
<br>
The fact that Bush himself confesses his decision to send troops to Iraq was based on `intelligence that proved false', in his recent memoir Decision Points, adds a sense of topicality to the film. Watch it to get a dekko on how super powers err.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Lemeul Gulliver (Jack Black), an ordinary mail room clerk in a newspaper, sets out on an ordinary journey, after being assigned to write a travel piece on Bermuda by the pretty travel editor, Darcy (Amanda Peet). However, the journey turns out to be an extraordinary adventure, when Gulliver's boat capsizes and he lands up on a strange island called Lilliput where he must help the tiny islanders to defend themselves against the evil general Edward (Chris O'Dowd).<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Don't even think this is going to be an encounter with Jonathan Swift's 18th-century classic that makes for an excellent read even today. Jack Black's Gulliver is a born-again hero who tries to grab eyeballs in a post-Avatar world as Gavatar. And when he's not gassing about surviving the Titanic tragedy, he is busy trying to convince the quaint Lilliputians of his larger-than-life status as the First Citizen of the Island of Manhattan!<br>
<br>
Hey, but what kind of a Prez is this Gulliver guy? He can't even save the islanders from the despotic designs of a pompous General who tramples all over the natives in a Transformer-type armour and wants to marry the princess (Emily Blunt), even though she is terribly bored by him. Left to herself, Princess Mary would like to spend her life with the cute commoner Horatio (Jason Segal), specially after he is being tutored in the state-of-the-art style of wooing by the lovelorn Gulliver. This new age Romeo may not have been able to express his own feelings for his travel editor, Darcy (Amanda Peet), but he sure can make Horatio sing and dance his way into the Princess' heart.<br>
<br>
But can the man from Manhattan end up as a zero? Never. It's not long before he realises what size actually means -- you got to be enormous inside, rather than outside, to actually make a difference to the world. The Lilliputians do find their hero who wages a final battle to save their honour.<br>
<br>
Shot in 3-D, this revisionist take on Swift's novel may not be spectacular in terms of special effects, but it has enough fun and games to engage the family. Watch out for Jack Black's zany rendition of the classic hero who is first held captive by pint-sized people and then punched around by a giant-sized doll.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Super baddie Megamind (Will Ferrell) defeats the super good guy, Metro Man (Brad Pitt) in a duel and hopes to rule uninterrupted over Metrocity. But his joy is short-lived, for what does a villain do without a hero? Megamind needs someone to fight with and ends up creating Titan, a made-to-order hero with Metro Man's DNA. Trouble begins when the woman he loves, reporter Roxanne (Tina Fey) turns to him for help when Titan turns rogue.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Can bad guys turn good? Are heroes made, not born? Can a villain grow into a hero? Good questions. Meaningful questions. Topical questions. Megamind maybe an animation film, meant to please kids with its wonderful imagery. But behind all the artistry, there are important philosophical -- and ethical -- debates. And the fact that they are conducted in a humorous and breezy manner only adds value to the film.<br>
<br>
Megamind is one of the cutest villains in contemporary cinema. With his bulbous blue head and his delightful one-liners, he is a swashbuckling hero, even when he is bad. But when he reluctantly turns good, he is even better. I'm not supposed to save the day. I'm not supposed to walk off into the sunset. I'm not supposed to get the girl. I'm the bad guy, he plaintively cries when positive stuff begins to happen in his blackguard life. The city starts looking up at him as a hero and feisty Roxanne begins to fall for him. And before he knows it, he's stepping into the shoes of Metro Man who seems to be too bored of playing good guy, over and again.<br>
<br>
The animation's great and so are the voice-overs. If Brad Pitt plays a bored Metro Man with lazy charm, then Will Ferrell is excellent as Megamind. He deserves a special mention for his take on Marlon Brando which almost brings the house down. A fun film that should not be missed, Megamind does make for a Merry Christmas.<br>

Their daughter Sally (Naomi Watts), on the other hand, can no longer cope with a struggling writer as a husband (Josh Brolin) and plans to call her marriage off. So what's next for each one of them?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> This one's straight out of a fairy tale...turned splitsville. Picture this. Couple 1: Alfie (Anthony Hopkins) and Helena (Gemma Jones) have lost interest in each other 40 years after marriage. No morning walks. No moments in bed. The outcome? One looks for love outside marriage in the form of the too-hot-to-handle blonde, Charmain (Lucy Punch), the other takes to the inhibitions-are-better formula, courtesy a charlatan fortune teller. Couple 2: Sally (Naomi Watts) has had enough of her novelist hubby Roy's one time success phenomenon, while Roy (Josh Brolin) just can't stop re-writing his second novel. The outcome? One falls for her handsome art gallery owner boss, Greg (Antonio Banderas), while Roy chooses to wonder who his next door neighbour in red is. Sounds complicated? Not really till the fairy tale turns into reality: You will meet a stranger for sure, though not necessarily a tall, dark one. Next are a few sublime moments and sometimes hysterically funny dialogues in throwaway bits.<br>
<br>
But that's not why you'd go to see this film. The movie has you desperately waiting to get glimpses of Freida Pinto and her much talked about tryst with Hollywood after Slumdog Millionaire. As the mystery woman who catches Roy's gaze right from day one, our `exotic' Dia doesn't contribute much to the plot. The only time we really hear her is when she expresses her desire to be someone's muse. And the only time we really see her is when she's sobbing before dad (Anupam Kher) as she gives up on her business-minded fiancee for Roy. For the rest, she's just the woman on the window!<br>

Ain't writer/director Woody Allen's best. But if you've seen 39 of his earlier films, you must see the 40th too!<br>

The ordinary Math teacher from Wisconsin is soon jumping off balconies and fleeing bullets as he gets embroiled in a two billion dollar heist. All for the sake of love...<br>
<br>
Movie Review: One would have thought they'd scorch the screen with their chemistry. Yet, ironically, Johhny Depp and Angelina Jolie simply simmer in this romantic thriller which fails to set the screen on fire, despite bringing together a hot and happening pair. Depp seems a bit out of depth and Jolie's somewhat stiff and distant in a drama that required them to build up a tempestuous romance neath the shadow of bullets and guns.<br>
<br>
The high point of The Tourist is its touristy setting where all the action explodes against the scenic backdrop of Venice with its picture postcard waterways and its gilded interiors. One of the most charming sequences sees Depp running across roofs and jumping down balconies in a pyjama suit while being chased by a gang of gun-toting assassins. All this, while a mannequin-like Ms Jolie watches with wonder and dismay. For yes, the lady is determined to save the tourist from the psychopathic gangster who wants his stolen wealth back, any which way. Or is it the tourist who wants to save her from the danger that lurks in the canals and alleys of the picture-perfect town?<<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Imagine if the worst fears of the video-games-are-vile lobbyists come true?

<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Obviously inspired by Sergio Leone, Korean film maker Sngmoo Lee creates an interesting martial arts drama that draws heavily from a number of sources. On the one hand, there is the wild expanse and the riveting canvas of the good old westerns which are used as a backdrop for the Oriental martial arts to explode on the screen. And on the other hand, there is the carnival-like grotesque palette of The Joker's playground -- Gotham City. Clowns, jesters, circus members, a mauled madcap villain along with masked, Matrix-like swordsmen: these are the people who flit in and out of the battleground as our silent, smouldering vigilante hero (Jang Dong Gun) fights for justice and life...Yes, he must protect the kid despite being aware of the fact that she'll grow up to be his nemesis.<br>

He wants to avenge the murder of his brother in a botched up bank heist and sets out killing all the suspects, one by one. But someone seems to have hired an assassin (Oliver Jackson Cohen) to kill him instead. Who is the mysterious man and who will strike first?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> When Dwayne Johnson's around, you expect the screen to explode. Specially when you know he is not strutting his comic avatar as in films like Tooth Fairy and The Game Plan. His hard Rock physique and stony face appeal has managed to entertain viewers, both in high-drama wrestle mania bouts and in films like Scorpion King which fully exploit his charisma.<br>
<br>
He does don the action hero avatar here as the silent, raging and murderous hitman who is hell bent on revenge. But the action cuts are watered down and the plot hangs too loosely on a wafer-thin vengeance track. Also, there are too many characters who flit in and out with assorted weapons, motives and stories from the troubled past. You kind of loose concentration with all the comings and goings. Add to this Billy Bob Thornton's wishy-washy cop-on-the-edge act and his blow hot-blow cold chemistry with his associate (Carla Gugino) and you have a film that should have pumped the adrenalin faster. Much Faster....<br>
<br>
Watch out for a few stylish camera angles, a bit of smart editing and fragments of action cuts that are arresting.

But this time, Lucy and Edmund are joined by their cousin Eustace who begins as a reluctant voyager on the mystical ship, the Dawn Treader, but ends up a true hero in an adventure which sees them battling sea serpents, evil creatures and the wicked White Witch (Tilda Swinton).<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Doesn't matter if you haven't read the Narnia Chronicles by CS Lewis. Doesn't matter if you haven't seen the earlier sequels too. The third part in the fantasy series holds merit on its own and manages to hold you in your seat with its mix of make-believe, special effects and fairy tale folklore.<br>
<br>
The fact that the film is in 3D makes it even more inviting for the sword fights, the dragon fires and the choppy sea hits you in your face as you try to keep pace with the Pevensies in their traditional battle of good against evil.<br>
<br>
Adding fire to their heroics is their whiny, almost offensive cousin Eustace, who grows into an unlikely hero as the danger threatens. His unusual friendship with braveheart Reepicheep is extremely enticing. Of course, we would have loved to have more of the majestic Aslan and the mean White Witch, specially since the brother-sister duo are growing up fast and may not have access to magical, mystical Narnia for long. But we aren't complaining. Specially since there's so little of make-believe left in this mundane world.<br>

Against all odds, Chenery manages to call the shots in a man's world, ultimately leading to what till date is said to be the greatest racehorse of all time...<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> This one's not about the horse. Remember the 1973 Triple Crown (The Wood Memorial, Kentucky Derby and The Belmont Stakes) winner, Secretariat? And it's not about its jockey. Not even its trainer. It's about the horse owner Penny Chenery (Dianne Lane), the old school Hollywood's loving-mother-turned-strong willed-wife-and-devoted daughter. And what's she determined about? Keeping her dads Meadow afloat even if she does not know anything about horses.<br>
<br>
Based on a true story, Secretariat is a dedication to the Triple Crown winner -- racehorse Secretariat that graced the covers of three magazines, Time, Newsweek, and Sports Illustrated, first time ever in 25 years in 1973. Providing the initial drama are the trials and tribulations of our homemaker-turned-woman of substance, Penny Chenery who hires a veteran trainer, Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich) and takes on winning jockey, Dyland Walsh (Jack Tweedy) to make her race-track dreams come true.<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> This is the third collaboration between director Tony Scott and Denzel Washington. The last time they came together they were talking about another locomotive on the loose in Taking of Pelham 123. Earlier, they pooled talent in the old school thriller Deja Vu. This time, the action unfolds full throttle as Denzel Washington and his newbie associate Chris Pine chase another rogue train which threatens to demolish a small town in Pennsylvania with its toxic cargo.

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Considering the cast, this should have been an explosive film. But RED doesn't really blow up the screen. Of course there are ample moments of high-decibel action laced with intermittent humour that make it an interesting watch. Even the veteran cast doesn't leave you complaining. If Bruce Willis rekindles his Die Hard fervour and manages to romance the phone call in the midst of all the gunfire, then John Malkovich proves he's matchless when it comes to playing the man on the edge. Morgan Freeman is his usual dependable self, while Helen Mirren showcases a new self. She sparkles and dazzles as a female 007 who's adept both at word play and gun play. But the high-point of the film are its finely choreographed action sequences. You wish there were more of them.<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Spot the one big difference. Hogwart's gone. Yes, the first part of the last HP film does have the dearly beloved trio -- Harry, Hermione, Ron -- testing their skills, but not in the fondly familiar environs of Hogwarts. The comfort zone's gone and with it have vanished most of the familiar fraternity. Even Ginny Weasley gets to play a two-minute scene and so does Hagrid and Snape.

Yet, he remains a hero-figure you can't end up hating, despite his flawed personality and his ambivalent ethics. And that's the hallmark of all great story-telling.

But then, that's what director Alexandre Aja has always loved doing: shocking and numbing you with the barbaric depiction of death. Remember his re-make of the The Hills Have Eyes. This time he picks up the 1978 film, Piranha and invests it with his signature style. The placid Lake Victoria is transformed into a raging red cesspool as the mean monsters devour all the pretty people who become easy prey. Limbs are chopped off, torsos are dismembered, eyes are gorged out, heads are yanked off, but you still keep watching. Because B-grade Hollywood can be fun too, specially if it has the formula right.

<span>Movie Review<span>: Two emotions. Diametrically opposed. On the one hand, it's heart-rending to see John Travolta slipping into insignificant roles after giving us such iconic performances in films like Saturday Night Fever, Face/Off, Pulp Fiction. The sheer mediocrity of the roles that are coming to him now literally makes you want to cry, because hey, John isn't an Old Dog, not as yet. On the other hand, you want to thank God it's Travolta. For here's an actor who is watchable in the pulpiest of fiction that dares to parade as film.<br>
<br>
Case in point being From Paris With Love where his quintessential swagger and irreverence lends a sparkle and wit to the run-of-the-mill character of a cop. As the high-on-adrenalin, coke-snorting, foul-mouthed, trigger-happy government agent, he crackles and bursts across the screen. More importantly, he serves as a perfect foil to Jonathan Rhys Meyers sober, laid-back and peace-loving officer who shivers at the thought of killing somebody. Travolta is a thoroughbred man of action who is literally wedded to his custom-made gun which he addresses as Mrs Jones. Rampaging across the underbelly of Paris, John and Mrs Jones create mayhem, shooting down almost all the suspects: terrorists, drug peddlers, pimps. And when Mrs Jones isn't enough, he picks up a bazooka and goes berserk on a crowded freeway.<br>
<br>
The film may be the usual action cut that comes tumbling off the Hollywood conveyor belt, but the tumult of Travolta makes it worth a visit. </span></span></span></span></span>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are the Other guys. Which means, they are the non-action, non-hero types who must linger in the shadows, relegated to doing the paperwork, while Samuel L Jackson and Dwanye Johnson play the heroic cops who walk away with all the applause. Of course, Ferrell and Wahlberg are cops too, but nobody takes them seriously, until they get a chance to prove their mettle when a financial scandal comes up. Can the goofballs gear up for high drama in the field?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> This is a buddy-cop movie that makes for a few laughs and provides enough entertainment with its high-profile cast credits. Ferrell and Wahlberg make a fine pair simply because they play opposites. While Ferrell is the amiable accountant in the police department and has no problems spending hours on his desk, Wahlberg is the cocky types, desperate for some real drama in the streets. More importantly, Ferrell seems to have an irresistible appeal when it comes to the fairer sex, despite his dormant mojo. Not only does he have a wife (Eva Mendes) that drives men crazy, he seems to be still wanted by his ex-girl friend (Natalie Zea). Needless to say, Wahlberg can hardly understand why and where his buddy's sexual magnetism lies?<br>
<br>
Light and breezy, The Other Guys is your usual cop house comedy which runs through a familiar track where fifteen minutes of fame do come, but only when our common man types have been truly tried and tested.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), a wannabe journalist, goes on a pre-honeymoon trip to Verona with her fiancee, Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal) and ends up in the city of Romeo and Juliet, with stars in her eyes. But the stars soon begin to fade when she realises her boyfriend is more interested in doing research for his new restaurant than romancing her.<br>
<br>
She fills her empty hours by joining a bunch of ladies who call themselves Juliet's secretaries and play agony aunts by addressing the love laments of all the disheartened lovers who pin letters beneath the famed balcony of Juliet. Sophie answers a letter written by a woman (Vanessa Redgrave) 50 years ago and finds herself poised on the threshold of a new romance when Redgrave lands up in Verona with her handsome grandson, Charles (Christopher Egan).<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> There's something about Romeo and Juliet that keeps you swearing by love and all that mush, time and again. Letters to Juliet is such a predictable love story and yet it tugs at your heart with its celebration of the oldest emotion on earth. You know wide-eyed Sophie's soon going to fall out of love with her scatter-brained beau. You also know she's going to fall in love with the priggish new man in her life, the all-English, American-mocking Charles, even as you are sure his grandmother (Vanessa Redgrave) will be successful in her hunt. Yes, she will definitely find the Italian (Franco Nero) she left 50 years ago to settle for traditional English domesticity.<br>
<br>
But does it matter? Never. The film may move in traditional style, but there is enough beauty and romance to keep you smiling, cheering and believing. Sophie's interactions with almost all the people in her life have a charming serenity and a vivacity that leaves you hungering for more. If her equation with fiancee, Gael Garcia Bernal, makes you chuckle, then her encounters with the arrogant and supercilious Charles (Christopher Egan) fill you with wicked delight. Charles even scoffs at her for `jamming' Oh my God and Awesome in one sentence! But more than all this, it is the bond which she strikes with the poised and genteel Redgrave that lifts your spirits completely. The actor can still manage to make romance seem so alluring, despite her age, and her pairing with real life partner, Franco Nero makes a perfect portrait of togetherness.<br>
<br>
Set against the breathtaking scenery of the Tuscan backdrop, Letters to Juliet is a love story that makes you want to believe in the legend of Romeo and Juliet.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Jennifer Aniston tries to keep pace with her biological clock and decides to go in for artificial insemination when she fails to find a boyfriend who can be husband material too. Why escape the joys of motherhood, she tells herself and finds a suitable donor in Patrick Wilson, an assistant professor of feminist studies at Columbia. But best friend, Jason Bateman, accidentally makes a switch, replacing the donor's sperm with his own.<br>
<br>
Of course, Aniston has no idea about it and is confronted with the seedy truth, seven years later when her son, Sebastian seems to have a greater affinity with her best friend (Bateman) rather than with his biological father, Wilson.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>Where have all the husbands gone? Just a few weeks ago, it was Jennifer Lopez who opted for artificial insemination because she couldn't find the perfect mate in Back-up Plan. This time, it's 40-year-old feminist TV producer, Jennifer Aniston who inseminates herself with a turkey baster, when she fails to find her Mr Right: a man who would double up as perfect husband and great daddy to her unborn kid.<br>
<br>
Are these really the new age feminists that Hollywood rom-coms are trying to throw up? You got to be joking! It doesn't take long for both our Jennifers to realise that single motherhood is hardly an option for the independent woman even as a world-without-men is a desolate, despicable and disastrous scenario for the sassy singleton. Lopez falls in love with a cheese farmer on the day she inseminates herself, while Aniston fails to pay heed to best friend Bateman's warnings, only to end up falling in love with him, seven years later. Of course, before that, she tries her best to bond with her son's supposedly biological father, Patrick Wilson who sadly shares no chemistry with neither the mom, nor his son. The poor professor tries his best to strike a rapport with his melancholic, neurotic, high-strung six-year-old son, Sebastian (Thomas Robinson) but ends up awkward and embarrassed after a disastrous birthday party in Central Park. It doesn't take long before Aniston realises why Sebastian seems to be bonding so well with the also-neurotic Bateman, who pitches in as the baby-sitter, while Aniston desperately tries to romance the wrong daddy.<br>
<br>
The film unfolds like a predictable rom-com, but has its moments, mostly conjured up by the young kid, Thomas Robinson who does a fine tango with the self-absorbed, emotional and somewhat funny Bateman. Robinson may have a personality disorder, but it sure is an engaging one. For who wouldn't be drawn towards a kid who prefers causes like global warming and animal welfare over video gaming and cartoon network! As for Aniston, she's likeable, as always, in a candy floss way that seems to come naturally to her.<br>
<br>
Sweet, sentimental and sufficiently funny, The Switch is a decent weekend watch.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Liz Gilbert (Julia Roberts) isn't too happy with her life. So what if she's married, loved and has a successful career as a New York based writer. Where's my inner balance, she asks herself and sets out in search of her true identity. Difficult job? Not really. All it takes is three stops before the lady realizes it's finally time to stop.... First stop: Gorging on pasta in Italy. Second stop: Meditating in India. Third stop: Falling in love in Bali.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Okay, so everybody knows the movie is based on the book that spent 150 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. Elizabeth Gilbert's autobiographical account of the sensuous and spiritual discovery of the self has found many avid readers, the world over. India has been a special market because of its India focus.... More of that later.<br>
<br>
Everybody also knows that the film hasn't been as popular as the book on the international circuit, with most critics panning it for its lack-lustre rendition of the written text. We'd like to tread the middle path. While it may not be as alluring as the book, the film does manage to carry you through its cross-country journey, peppered with scenic locales and attention-grabbing characters. And the credit mostly goes to Julia Roberts who adds flesh and blood to the protagonist, as only she can. Julia's Liz is actually quite adorable: confused, chaotic, intelligent, sensitive, restless, honest and sexy too. So much so, you can understand why she has all the men following her all around. If her husband (Billy Crudup) can't get over her, despite the divorce, boyfriend David (James Franco) waits for her longingly on the doorstep when she bids him good-bye. As for the irresistible Felipe (Javier Bardem), he takes just a couple of days to shed his single-is-best mindset and propose ever-after to the reluctant pilgrim, promising to take her on a boat trip to an island with hundreds of parrots. Now who can say no to that!<br>
<br>
Liz can. Because Liz feels she'll lose her balance (read identity) if she gives in to love. Obviously, there are still some more lessons left to learn, despite her days of introspection and meditation. All it takes is a final tete-tete with her fav guru (Hadi Subiyanto), a toothless medicine man in Bali, for Liz to realize that love and identity are hardly antagonistic. More importantly, Javier Bardem isn't someone you should send away!<br>
<br>
Now, we come to the most important question: Does the Indian chapter rock? Sadly, it's the weakest link in the story. Julia's gastronomic exploits in Rome and her romantic liaisons in Bali have a sensuous quality to them, while her Indian encounter is brimming over with cliches. There's Tulsi, the young girl who must be married against her wishes; there are the mosquitoes that threaten to give Liz malaria and there's `Richard from Texas' who tells her to drink Thumbs Up with a straw. Why? Because in India you don't touch anything, other than yourself, he explains. Ahem! Are we forgetting the cows and beggars?<br>
<br>
Overlook these minor irritants and you have a lot to savour. Like Julia's intense performance and Robert Richardson's rich cinematography. Go See Debate....Was the book better or the film?<br>

Can he cut loose from his old buddies, specially partner-in-crime, Jeremy Renner?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The Town proves one thing beyond doubt: Ben Affleck is a better director than an actor. He creates a gritty crime drama, peppered with some memorable characters and action sequences that have an old world charm about them. Shorn off all special effects, the gun fights and the chases have a mesmeric earthy expediency, even as the characters seem to be spilling real blood....Your heart goes out to them when they crumble and fall.<br>
<br>
Hey, but aren't they supposed to be bank robbers, this gang of ruthless ruffians who revel in donning nun's masks and terrorising the employees of sundry banks in blue-collared Charleston, before walking off with the loot that's mostly spent in beer and drugs? So how can you feel sorry for them? Now haven't we been saying it's the age of the anti-hero, time and again. In The Town, the grandest act comes from the most crooked one of them all: Jeremy Renner, the Hurt Locker hero, who lends a hypnotic appeal to his edgy Irishman act. Renner literally walks away with the film as Affleck's unpredictable buddy and accomplice in crime. Of course, Affleck does try and keep pace with his mercurial partner who is determined to wipe off the only witness to their crime, even if it happens to be the girl (Rebecca Hall) his leader loves.<br>
<br>
Watch The Town for its atmospherics, it's characterisations and for its vintage gangster film flavour.

He waits for his next assignment which entails providing a weapon to Mathilde (Thekla Reuten), another assassin, preparing for the kill. And while he waits, he encounters some soul curry.... like Clara (Violante Placido), the local hooker and Father Benedetto, the persistent priest. Will this be Edward's chance to reclaim life and love?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Catch the stillness, the silence, the solitariness and the sheer beauty of this film which unfolds with the elegance of a haiku.<br>
<br>
On the one hand, there is the sheer beauty of the Italian village which leaves you breathless, as cinematographer Martin Ruhe creates one luminescent canvas after the other: rolling hills, cobbled pathways, shimmering forests, shadowed interiors. And on the other hand, there is the stillness of George Clooney who literally lays bare the angst -- and the isolation -- of a hitman who must live alone, minus all friends and family and spend most of his time serenading cold steel (read weapons of destruction).<br>
<br>
The story may be familiar: a cold killer re-discovers the warmth of his heart when he sips coffee with an avuncular priest and falls in love with a beautiful woman. But Clooney lends a whole new dimension to the character as he battles his private demons with quiet ferocity and a sense of Shakespearean doom.<br>
<br>
Based on Martin Booths novel, 'A Very Private Gentleman', The American is an exquisite thriller.

Can Skype and long distance calls be the answer or is distance the biggest damper to hot-blooded love?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> This is a rom-com that rattles off into no-man's land, even before it takes off. And there isn't much that Drew Barrymore can do to salvage it, despite her pep factor. Can't blame her really, for the film doesn't demand anything from her, other than waiting for her boyfriend to pounce over her during his infrequent visits to her hometown.

<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Disney re-releases its perennial classic in 3-D, with a hope to capture a whole new audience of Playstation kids. Will it succeed? Hard to tell, because old classics like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Bambi, The Wizard of Oz seem to be quite unheard of these days when Gods of War and Super Mario rule. More importantly, their genteel tenor and generous sprinkling of song and dance might seem antiquated in a high decibel-high adrenalin world of breakneck action and speed.<br>
<br>
But that might just be the reason why you need to plan a special family dekko for a film that might seem like exotica to the joystick generation. Have them sit back and savour the antics of a candelabra, a mantlepiece clock and a talking teapot as they try and help their master, the Beast, find true love. Of course, how can we forget the therapeutic effect of the moral that lies enmeshed in every delightful fairy tale. Beauty and the Beast is essentially a salutation to the inner goodness that lies hidden in every beast. All you need is a catalyst (read Beauty) to bring it out....<br>
<br>
Like all Disney films, this one too boasts of great visuals and a vibrant music score. Strangely, the attempt to go 3-D hasn't really been a hundred per cent success and ends up as superficial and minimalist when compared to other recent 3-D marvels. It's mostly the flora and fauna that reach out to you, while the figures remain in the backdrop. Nevertheless, there's the sublime beauty of a forgotten world and the promise of happily-ever-after to draw you to one of your favourite fairy tales, once again.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas), the Wall Street anti-hero who won hearts -- and an Oscar -- in 1987 is back. He re-surfaces after spending an eight-year jail term for his financial misdemeanours and enters a world poised on the brink of a financial crisis.<br>
<br>
This time, he finds a new protegee in Jake Moore (Shia LaBeouf), an energy trader who happens to be his prospective son-in-law too. But before Gekko can get a hold on the changing world economic order, he must re-set his priorities and set his home in order by befriending his estranged daughter (Carrie Mulligan). More importantly, he must figure out if money is indeed the most priceless asset in a world that swears by bottomlines.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Circa 2008. The setting is recognisable. Grappling with the subprime crisis and the crash of the Wall Street czars, the US economic horizon is bloodied, brutal and gasping for breath. Enter Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) the new age Adam Smith who redefined the wealth of nations, 23 years ago by articulating his million dollar biz mantra: Greed is Good. Greed is right. Greed works. He walks out of prison, a lonely man, with no one waiting for him outside, not even his only daughter (Carrie Mulligan), who blames her father for all the family travails, including her brother's death. Gekko's learnt a lot of lessons in the last eight years. But the most important one he still needs to learn is whether greed is indeed good? And so he sets about-rediscovering his lost power, wealth, family, edicts and mantras against a familiar world -- Wall Street -- and an unfamiliar world order -- recession.<br>
<br>
Joining him in this perilous journey that threatens to rock sundry boats, once again, is young Jake (Shia LaBeouf), an ambitious investment banker who is egged on by two prime motives. Or is it three? First, he wants to avenge the death of his surrogate father, Lewis Zabel (Frank Langella) who heads a monolithic investment banking company which goes down under when the government refuses to bail it out. Lehman brothers, anyone? Second, he wants to bring about a rapproachment between the estranged Gekko father-daughter duo, simply because he loves the daughter and knows that she secretly pines for her father. And third, he wants to join the club because he knows if he isn't `inside', he's `outside'. He needs his father-in-law's loot (one million dollars, stashed away in a Swiss bank) to fund his dream project.<br>
<br>
Oliver Stone's Wall Street 2 may be the first film which actually takes a look at the global financial crisis from which the world still has to recover, but the drama is enthralling. And that's because Stone tells his story like a thriller, creating a series of unforgettable characters. While Shia LaBeouf's Jake Moore takes forward the legacy of Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen), the young, ambitious, amoral stockbroker who aligns forces with Gekko in part one, it is good old Gordon who plays the veteran war horse with a newfound agility and zest. Stone reserves some of the finest lines for Gekko, including a monologue where he lectures a young audience on their fate. ``You are fu***d!' he tells them, branding them the NINJA Generation which has No Income, No Jobs and No Assets. But this time round, he isn't merely the hard-balled corporate raider but displays heart as well. Watch him break down before his daughter and plead for forgiveness: truly touching! And then, there's the third power player: Josh Brolin. Brolin pitches in a powerful and arrogant performance as Bretton James who heads the securities firm, Churchill Schwartz and defines `MORE' as the only price that can be ascribed to him. Brolin's swashbuckling act as the archetypal Wall Street baddie stands up to Douglas' legendary Gordon Gekko who became a buccaneer hero to the nineties business school grads.<br>
<br>
Stone's film is not only topical, it holds out lessons for the future too. For as Gekko tells us: Greed has not only become greedier, it has become legal now. More importantly, money is the `bi**h that never sleeps....'<br>
<br>
P.S. Don't miss the reference to India. Langella rues the fact that he has to deal with unknown, unseen people from `Mumbai-tumbai', re-echoing Obama's fears of being Bangalored and Off-with-offshoring biz talk.<br>
<br>
Yes, the sequel has strength; Wall Street never sleeps, and Gordon Gekko still beckons.

Like so many other Indian girls, she ends up duped and disappointed. Her husband is not only two-timing her, he also subjects her to marital abuse. All this, while her tourist visa has expired and hope seems to be dimming on the horizon. Can Usha salvage her self-esteem, and her marriage?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The story is old. The treatment older. The tale of the innocent Indian girl who is packaged off to phoren grooms, pigging it out in downtown London or New York, doesn't really have anything new to offer, now that there have been umpteen films on the NRI dream turned sour. So you hope A Distant Mirage might have a fresh treatment to draw your attention to the issue all over again. But all you experience is a sense of deja vu.<br>
<br>
Usha's troubles, as she tries to cope with an abusive husband, are completely predictable, even as her long forays into the vegetable and grocery stores of Southall put you to sleep. Equally uninteresting is her playboy husband's dalliance with the `gori mem' (Jasmine Hyde), ending almost always in tepid touchy-feely business. The only time the film perks up is when Usha bonds with her girlfriend (Sohm Kapila) and tries to bravely pick up the strings of her life once again.<br>

Sadly, there isn't enough -- neither story, nor performances -- to sustain a decent run for A Distant Mirage. Too much has already been said on the issue.<pi></pi>

With time running out, Chev needs to really crank up his moves if he wants to survive for another sequel....<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> If you liked Crank 1 and are a Jason Statham buff, you might just end up enjoying this crazy Chev Chelios adventure too. But let's forewarn you: You got to have a yen for B-grade Hollywood fare. 'Cause Crank 2 is completely B-grade....<br>
<br>
Here's how. It's B-grade because bakwas (trash talk) holds centre stage. No one speaks straight. The screenplay is just a relentless string of foul language which literally explodes in your face. It's B-grade because believe-it-or-not is the baseline of the drama which encapsulates umpteen over the top sequences where Statham recharges his dying heart with jumper cables and then breaks into a Godzilla versus Ultraman feud. And when he's not running faster than cars or breaking bones, he's doing unmentionable stuff to his pole-dancer girl friend (Amy Smart) in crowded streets. It's B-grade too because there are a host of brawny and bikini-clad figures, bursting out of the screen from nowhere. And these include an overmade, grungy Bai Ling, playing the hooker with the heart of gold and the style of a slut.<br>
<br>
But then, should we be complaining? The film makers don't seem to be taking themselves seriously at all. Neither should we. So all you diehard action buffs can take a chance with Crank 2. It is high voltage action, albeit with a jaded edge.

According to director James Cameron, the Special Edition of Avatar, hitting theatres this week in a limited release, boasts of nine minutes of additional footage. This extended footage includes a few minutes of additional necking and petting between Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neyitri (Zoe Saldana) when they celebrate their love in the sylvan forest, another animal hunt where the tribe hunts down a new species of animals called Sturmbeests, more bioluminescent stuff in the night forest, including a new creature called the stingbat, a Drums of War sequence where the US army is given a rhyme and reason to destroy Pandora and a final addition in the death sequence of Tsu'tey where he accepts Jake's leadership and sends out an emotional salute to the new leader of the Na'vi people.<br>

<strong>Movie Review: </strong>Fun while it lasts, Grown Ups is a harmless little picnic film that celebrates friendship, even as it has something important to say. Get back to the outdoors, kids! it exclaims, urging today's tweens and teens to look beyond their playstation screens and FB friends for some real, hard-balled frolic and fun. How about some rock climbing, tree swinging, stone-pelting, roller-coasting, somersaulting, huh?<br>
<br>
At least that's what the grown up boys indulge in, with intense merriment and mirth. The re-union for the five friends is filled with moments of boyish fun, which even includes a basketball game, as in the days of yore. Of course, there's a lot of adult teasing and tearing each other apart too, with the wives trying their best to adjust to each other's peculiar habits. Quite a difficult task, specially when you have a high-society diva like Salma Hayek, all set to go to Milan for a fashion show, forced to exchange pleasantries with a homely haus frau, an unambitious mother-to-be and a mother who chooses to breast-feed her four-year-old in public view. The mercury rises further when Rob Schneider's oomphy daughters land up to re-bond with a dad who has a yen for older women, unlike the rest of his friends who like them young and hot.<br>

Savour the Sandler brand of humour with Grown Ups, a film that once again celebrates the spirit of childhood, like most of his comedies.<br>

Today, in its fifth instalment, the Predator series is no longer sexed up and has lost some of its charm. It might have worked, if the makers had tried to infuse an element of novelty in the script or the delineation of the blood thirsty creatures. True, Adrien Brody is an eminent actor and has an intensity that manages to transcend the mediocrity of script and scene. But, in a predictable cat and mouse game, there isn't much that the brooding Brody can do, other than play the hunted-turned-hunter who is hell-bent on surviving, any which way. Even if it means, making some rash decisions and earning the scorn of the rest of the threatened brood. Army sniper, Alice Braga does try to rein him in and plays the voice-of-conscience team mate. Indeed, a difficult task when hungry predators are hounding you with salivating jaws and the terrain around you is absolutely unfamiliar. And Laurence Fishburne makes an iffy appearance as a survivor who's managed to elude the killers for six seasons or more. But is that enough to carry the carnage forward?<br>
<br>
The special effects do appeal intermittently, and the spook show does hold your attention, here and there. But, by and large, the film unfolds as predictable sci-fi formula, celebrating pulp and gore.

It''s been a 3-D summer in Hollywood this year. If Avatar set a new benchmark for
this new fangled technique of cinema viewing, then certain other films made you
wonder what all the brouhaha was all about. Simply because there weren''t too
many things popping up and poking at you.<br /><br />But Despicable Me lives up
to its promise and is embellished with some thoroughbred three dimensional
special effects that promise to delight both young and old alike. Case in point:
the wisp of the precious ballet ticket that wafts through the breeze, the
gravity-defying antics of Gru''s army of yellow minions, the orphans''
roller-coaster ride with a reluctant Gru and the hi-tech space trip to the
moon....All great fun.<br /><br />Equally enthralling is the cute celebration of
the family-is-best track, where gruesome Gru grows from an evil sociopath into a
fond and fawning surrogate daddy who not only reads out bedside stories to his
brood of three young girls, he even hugs them to sleep and air dashes through
galaxies to attend their show of Swan Lake. All this, after he has tried his
best to resist their cutesy charms and play hard-boiled havoc-wrecker, to no
avail.<br /><br />The film has some dazzling animation, great voice-overs, a
smart and witty screenplay, genuine 3-D effects and a grungy lead character that
grows into a lovable Santa Claus who tells you what you''ve always known: East or
West, Family is Best!<br /><br />Grab your family and get moony about family

For, after all, that's the in-your-face declaration that Jacob makes in one of the most alluring scenes in the film. ``Face it, I'm much hotter than you,'' he tells the 109-year-old cold cut Cullen and slips under the covers -- six-packed and shirtless -- to warm a shivering Bella on a cold mountain top.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>The world is divided into four nations -- Air, Water, Earth, Fire -- each living a life of its own, each living peacefully under the rule of the Avatar. Till the latter disappears and the Fire Nation launches an attack on the other three Nations to ensure global dominance is theirs. Does the Fire Nation take over? Or does the Avatar with his power to bend all elements get back to save nations from the turmoil?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>First things first. If you're on the lookout for something as dramatically, philosophically or strategically driven as Shyamalan's The Village, Signs or Unbreakable, The Last Airbender is not the one for you. Not to say there's nothing in there for you. Martial arts, to the bending of the elements, costume design to the sets, the actual filming locations, this movie is a visual treat, served in 3D style.<br>
<br>
But, it's mostly meant for tweens, based as it is on a popular Nickleodeon show which Shyamalan used to regularly watch with his seven-year-old son. The heroes are believable... out there to do things achievable... as they confront villains easy-to-handle. All this and more, with a storyline not quite complicated.<br>
<br>
It's been a century, Fire Lord Ozai (Cliff Curtiz) continues to imprison anyone born with the power to bend elements of nature, when siblings Katara (Nicola Peltz) and Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) from the Water Nation find a mysterious boy trapped beneath the ice. Is that the Avatar? Yes, though this Avatar a.k.a Aang (Noah Ringer) is yet to master all elements of nature. Why? Because he ran away during his `enlightenment days' when he was told an `Avatar could have no family; an Avatar needs to make sacrifices to rise up the ladder'. But hey, no worry, for Katara and Sokka help him master the `emotional art' of water bending. And that's where we get our visual tamasha from. Don't miss out the water-benders do kata on boats surrounded by glaciers, the blending of the martial arts, the bending of all other elements. But as they inch nearer to their goal, the group must evade Prince Zuko (Dev Patel) too, the banished son of Lord Ozai who is `too soft and not fit to wear the Fire military uniform'. Does our `soft warrior' eventually turn into a hard, Avatar-trapper? Or does the movie leave scope for a possible sequel to follow soon? Find out.<br>
<br>
So, where exactly does the bending go wrong? First, we really needed to see Aang develop significantly on his journey to become the Avatar. Except for the climactic scene at the water-bender city, the bending seems too unconvincing despite its 3D transformation. Second, in terms of the special effects, we wish we had more of those element-bending techniques working for real. Imagine one getting wet each time a globe of water splashed on them. Imagine one getting burnt each time a ball of fire blasted around them. Ah, for all those delicious tweeny fantasies!<br>
<br>
Of course, to make up for that, Shyamalan gives us enough benders for the mind. Analyse this: There are reasons we are all born; we need to find them. There are certain things the human kind should not tamper with -- Nature and its spirit is one of them... The Fire Nation is misusing knowledge to create something that'll turn the moon red... In our hearts, all nations (here Air, Water, Earth, Fire) are one... Lesson-lender, anyone?<br>
<br>
Airbender may not be vintage Shyamalan, but it sure is fun viewing for young adult fiction buffs.

But soon, there's trouble in paradise: Nikki falls in love with the pretty waitress, Heather (Margarita Leveiva) who ironically, seems to have a fetish for Mercs and moneyed men too. What's next?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> There is a sweet irony in this story that transports Spread from where it dangerously dangles: C-grade Hollywood to watchable drama. And strangely, most of the drama comes from the parting shot, where a giant toad tries to gobble a white mouse and takes his time swallowing it. Metaphor, anyone? Is that the big bad dream city (Los Angeles) guzzling the millions of dream chasers who flock towards its dazzling lights?<br>
<br>
Kutcher sufficiently slips into the shoes of a pretty boy who is willing to do pretty much for the kingsize lifestyle. Slipping out of one convenient relationship after the other, he manages to find a degree of permanence with the super-rich Samantha, who indulges him, but only until he delivers....At the first sign of neglect, she cracks up and cracks him up too, leaving him no option but to end up homeless -- and benefactor-less-- again. That is, if he wants his self-respect to remain intact. But more than self-respect, there's something else that has Nikki obsessing: his love for the mysterious and elusive waitress, Heather, who ends up in different cars each night. sometimes, it's a Mercedes and sometimes, it's a Porche, with half-lit cigars spilling out of the ash trays. Doesn't take long for Nikki to figure out another gold-digger like him....The toy boy and the hooker do try to work out deals together, but the business partnership doesn't last for long. Why? Because romance sets in. It's bitter sweet romance, that can't stand a chance before bitter and harsh reality.<br>

<br>
Storm Warriors 1, the earlier sequel was released almost 11 years ago and did manage to create a following for the Pang brothers. This time again, the director duo return with a special effects orchestrated adrenaline-pumper that has enough to offer for action aficionados.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>It's essentially a one-liner plot that anchors all the clash-bang baazooka. Comic book warriors Cloud (Aaron Kwok) and Wind (Ekin Cheng) must save China from the ungodly Mr Godless. And the only way they can do it is by undergoing extreme martial arts training which includes some psychological and ethical tampering too. If they really want to win this war against evil, then Wind must turn sufficiently evil too, according to their tutor, aptly called Nameless (Kenny Ho). But there's a catch. If Wind turns completely evil, there shall be havoc and no one shall have the power to control his murderous spree. So, how does Wind measure the modicum of vile he must inject into his psyche if he wants his sword to slash the right heads only? Can the beautiful Second Dream (Charlene Choi) bring him back from the brink; or is it left to his old comrade Cloud to tame his sword and turn his eyes back from mean yellow to gentle brown...<br>

This high-decibel film opens with an explosive sequence that sees a bunch of kids being meticulously saved by our bunch of heroes from the jungles of Bolivia and then ironically blown off in the SOS helicopter that was supposed to ferry them to safety. After that too, the boom-boom and the slow motion wild-pack-walk is relentless, with zany action set-pieces literally rolling off the conveyor belt in quick succession as the hunted CIA men try to settle scores and set the record straight. Personal favourite: the supposed tele-kinetic shoot-out!! Debonair bad man Max (Jason Patric) is hellish fun too with his trigger happy ways and his witty one-liners.

His mum gives him three choices: pack up your toys either for the attic, the day care centre or the trash can. Indeed, a difficult choice for Andy who still gets gooey and misty-eyed when he opens up his childhood Pandora's box brimming over with precious memories: cowboy Woody, cowgirl Jessie, Space Ranger Buzz Lightear, Rex, Ham, the Potato Heads and co. For Andy, there are just two options: Woody goes with him to college and the rest nestle in the attic. But a mix-up has them all end up in the devious day care centre, ruled by the tyrannical hugging bear. Can the Toys find their way back home after escaping the dictatorship and demolition Big question.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Absolutely awesome! If Toy Story 1 conjured up a whole new world for kids and set up a new benchmark in animation, then Toy Story 3 is a befitting sequel to the franchise. There is colour, verve, drama, action, comedy, romance and 3D too. Add to this, a few wonderful take-home morals for our young and old viewers, and what more can you want. Yes, Toy Story 3 is that perfect paisa-vasool family entertainer packaged in characteristic Hollywood pizzazz.<br>
<br>
Thematically, the third part smartly carries forward the wondrous experiences of Woody (Tom Hanks) and his friends as they try to come to terms with the darker side of life after years of hugging and petting. The toys must learn to cope with the fear of rejection and the insecurity of being unwanted. After the warmth of Andy's room, they find themselves struggling for survival in their inconducive new environs, where on the one hand roguish kids are ready to tear them apart; and on the other, the self appointed, mean dictator of the day care centre is hell bent on making slaves out of them. So you have Woody, leading an action packed revolt against the tyrant bear (Ned Beatty) and his evil cohorts like Ken (Michael Keaton), Big Baby and Monkey. But before he can set his buddies free and flee to safety, he must undo what the bearish Lot-sa has done to his best friend Buzz (Tim Allen). The friendly Space Ranger has suddenly crossed sides and is working against the welfare of his former friends. But hey what's that? A re-boot has Buzz donning the role of Don Juan and giving us some of the most zany moments of the film. Go have your fill...<br>
<br>
Mantra-wise too, you will find loads to inspire your kids at the end of all the action and drama. Woody and co. are definitely not pieces of plastic with their pep pills on the value of team spirit, friendship, loyalty and the importance of standing up to bullys, aggressors and exploiters. And that's not all, adults too can take home their favourite one liner: authority comes from the consensus of the governed, not from fear! That's cowgirl Jessie's feisty rebuke to fascistic Lot-sa and the lot-sa real life leaders like him. Enjoy!

They call themselves the A-Team and have a reputation of solving any and every case with the most unorthodox measures. Naturally, it doesn't take long for them to stage daring escapes and re-group under the leadership of maverick colonel Hannibal Smith (Liam Neeson).<br>

The motive: to clear their name and prove their patriotism, while the whole US army doubts their integrity. Except for Captain Sosa (Jessica Biel) who still nurtures a soft spot for her ex, Lt. Templeton Faceman Peck (Bradley Cooper). The others in the crack team include tough guy Bosco Baracus and ace pilot `Howlin' Mad Murdoch.<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> A-Team is an unbridled adrenalin rush all the way. You don't get the time to sit back and think of story and all that stuff in the thud and the rumble of the action set pieces that explode in your face.<br>
<br>
Leading the lean-mean team is Liam Neeson who is determined to prove his innocence, after being convicted of stealing some engraving plates, which have caused a flush of counterfeit US dollars to flood the battle-scarred country. Like the quintessential leader of the wolf pack, Neeson harnesses the forces of the foursome, which essentially means the following: giant Jackson must crash through gun battles at crucial junctures on vrooming Harleys, Sharlto Copley must fly planes at breakneck speed, causing acute air sickness to anyone who can dare to keep his eyes open and playboy Cooper must dazzle with his with, charm and sharp shooting abilities, when he's not taking his shirt off, flinging tanks down the sky, or flirting with his ex, the delightful alpha girl, Jessica Biel.<br>
<br>
Based on the popular TV series of the 1980s, The A-Team is strictly for action buffs who love to OD on high-decibel AXN cuts. The action is superbly crafted, leaving no room for anything else. Of course, the foursome do add a lot of charm and charisma to the lead characters, specially Cooper who gets more and more irresistible after Hangover.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Twelve-year-old Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) moves from Detroit to Beijing with his mother (Taraji P Henson) and hates the relocation. He has reason to do so, because the school bullies insist on bashing him up whenever they see him talking to the pretty Ms Mei Ying, in and outside class. Dre realises its time to hit back and finds his personal karate teacher in Mr Han (Jackie Chan), the mysterious maintenance, who becomes a surrogate father to the lonely tween. Mr Han tutors him both in the martial arts and the art of living and helps him regain his lost confidence.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>The film is a re-boot of the 1980's classic which had become a cult film for the '80s teens. It essentially tries to posit Jaden Smith as a chip off the old block (Will Smith) and showcase the talents of the young boy who had already won hearts in his touching performance as Will Smith's son in The Pursuit of Happyness.<br>
<br>
Does Jaden deliver? Indeed, he does, with his dread locks and loads of attitude which makes Dre Parker one of the smartest imports from America in this bustling Beijing neighbourhood. Not only does he manage to catch the attention of all the bullies in school, he also manages to charm his way into pretty Ms Mei Ying's life, that usually revolves around the high arts, leaving little room for tween fun and games. And if that's not enough attention already, our young hero also succeeds in convincing the unfriendly handyman, Mr Han (Jackie Chan) to create a karate champion out of him: one who can not only learn to conquer all his weaknesses but can also out-chop all the bullies in a martial arts marathon match. All this, with just a few hiccups and a whole lot of tutor-taught bonding between Jackie and Jaden.<br>
<br>
The film does have a lot to offer to young adults, but fails to rise to cult status. And that's only because the martial arts display (the stuff our boisterous teens holler for) is somewhat marginalised by the drama and relationship building which takes up a lot of screen time. The semi romance between Mei Ying and Dre and the prolonged training sequences involving Mr Han and Dre do seem to test the patience of our adrenalin-driven young viewers. Give us the Chopsucky, and give it fast: you can almost hear them screaming!<br>
<br>
Jackie Chan sheds his comic sheen for a more serious visage; Jaden is fluid motion and poetry and the locales (the Forbidden City, the Great Wall of China) are stunning. Celebrate the dragon....<br>

And like all other patriotic Englishmen, he was fighting on two fronts: first the less principled Prince John (Oscar Issac) who was hell bent on wringing the common men dry with his irrational tax system and second, the approaching French army which was working through an English spy, Godfrey (Mark Strong). Add to this, his little charade where he is forced to play the husband of a recently widowed Marion (Cate Blanchett) by her father-in-law (Max von Sydow) and you have Robin Longstride's days full of intrigue in a fast changing political landscape.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>This is one more collaboration between the ace duo of director Ridley Scott and actor Russell Crowe. Yet, sadly, it ain't no Gladiator, neither in terms of histrionics nor on the scale of an epic. Blame it solely on the story. Scott has chosen on a period of time before the legend of Robin (of the) Hood was actually born. Naturally, this is a more conventional Robin who doesn't break the rules, doesn't infringe the laws and is quite unlike the flamboyant outlaw that we have got used to seeing as the quintessential Robin Hood character. Even his arch enemy, the Sheriff of Nottingham, hasn't evolved as a full blown foe and remains in the shadow as the bad guy's mantle is donned by a new character: Godfrey, the French spy, who has no qualms of conscience bartering away the prestige of the throne of England to the scheming French. All that the Sheriff gets to do is force a kiss on the feisty Marion, as she ploughs her fields and fobs him off. Alan Rickman, (the unforgettable Sheriff in the Kevin Costner version) where art thou!<br>
<br>
So, the point we are trying to emphasise here is the fact that the action is missing in this version of Robin Hood, which ends with the suffix: The legend begins...or something like that. Unlike the brigand who leads his merry men through one high-testosterone archery encounter after the other in the earlier versions, this Robin is a more genteel hero who bathes, dines and breakfasts the bourgeois way. No rough and tumble and real fighting for him. Even his romance with Lady Marion is fleeting and sedate and cries out for Bryan Adam's brusque ode to love: remember `Everything I Do...'<br>
<br>
But comparisons are indeed odious. So, no complaints. And that's because Russell Crowe actually lends gravitas to the mythical character and gives him a Gladiatorial avatar, even as Cate Blanchett creates an alpha woman out of the uber feminine prototype of Maid Marion, who usually can't do without the protection of Robin Hood's brawny shoulders. But not our lady, who knows how to defend herself, well and proper.<br>
<br>
Go watch this version, because the sequel is bound to follow. And then, we are sure, all hell will break lose....Savour the lull before the storm.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>The foursome return with their feminist concerns. This time, the girl gang is grappling with a whole new set of problems, even as they embark on a vacation to Abu Dhabi. Carrie Bradshaw may be married for two years, but is she happy? Charlotte York may be a mother of two kids, but is she content? Miranda Hobbes may be a high profile lawyer, but does she have job satisfaction? Samantha Jones may be the best publicist in Manhattan, but can she manage her hormones?<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> The go-getter girls are truly at the crossroads, bogged down by different aspects of the mid-life crisis: motherhood, wifehood, menopause, the glass ceiling....Leading the brattish pack is Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) who doesn't know how to retain the `sparkle' in her two-year-old marriage to her avuncular husband who suddenly seems to have a craving for a third entity in their cosy domesticity. He wants a TV in the bedroom, much to the discomfiture of Carrie who can't see herself watching black and white Hollywood films, night after night, even though her husband thinks it's romantic. It Happened One Night is fine because it happens only one night, she yells, after a cosy viewing of the classic film. But day after day....Surely, it's time for a time-out before the magic disappears completely.<br>
<br>
The other girls have their own set of woes. Like Charlotte's yelling kids and her sexy nanny who chooses to do cartwheels minus her lingerie; Miranda's misogynist boss who hates her voice -- and her talent; and Samantha's disappearing oestrogen that needs artificial stimulants to keep her hot and happening, despite being `fifty plus f***@$g two.' They get a chance to escape from it all when Samantha receives an invitation to holiday in Abu Dhabi from one of her clients.<br>
<br>
And herein comes the problem. Once the girls arrive in Abu Dhabi, the film enters rough terrain. On the one hand it becomes more or less a touristy adventure where the foursome decide to `DO' the rich and prosperous Abu Dhabi after having undergone a long recession. And secondly, they decide to do it like stereotypical American tourists who view the exotic east as the quintessential backwaters. So, you have a series of insensitive and childish digs at the hijab, naqab, burqa, burkini and the antiquated laws of a land which can get you arrested for something as simple as kissing. OMG! gushes Carrie, as she sits back awe-struck to watch a native woman eat french fries through her hijab. And what's that, wonders a startled Samantha, when she hears the familiar call for prayer. And finally, the sisterhood seeks refuge from a group of belligerent sheikhs by hiding with a bunch of women who flaunt Louis Vitton and Prada beneath their burqas. Ah Amrika! When will you actually grow up and say Hello to an egalitarian world.<br>
<br>
But, if you can ignore this insensitivity and infantile vision -- which actually isn't something new from commonplace Hollywood -- the girls have enough to keep the momentum going. Silly one liners, goofy situational slip-ups and some genuinely funny gags, specially by Samantha (Kim Cattrall) do keep the tedium at bay. Not forgetting the Indian reference: the sundry `Haanjis' and the Indian character who once again, is truly third world: a butler who meets his wife back home in India, only when he has the money for an air ticket. For the rest of the while, he lingers in permanent servitude, serving sherbets and milk to his Amrikan memsaabs. Tch tch!<br>
<br>
The sequel may not be as spunky as the first film, yet, Sex and the City 2 has enough to keep the cosmo club grinning. Watch out for Sarah Jessica Parker's fashion folio and Kim Cattrall's wild abandon.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>A group of highschoolers in Springwood are having nightmares about a clawed killer stalking them in their dreams. What's more strange is that their injuries turn out to be real and they end up facing a bloody death while asleep. All this, while their friends, Nancy and Quentin watch helplessly. Can the traumatised teens actually put a stop to the killer's nasty plans?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Freddy Kreuger's back. After a startling debut in 1984, Hollywood's favourite teen slasher, returns after umpteen sequels which have seen him going about his favourite bloodsport -- tearing apart teens -- with varying states of glee. And during these 26 years, the teen guzzler has reportedly consumed 137 vulnerable young things already, all of them living at the high profile houses in Elm street. Some appetite, huh!<br>
<br>
Well, now that he's back after a prolonged hiatus, one would have thought he would have kept pace with the changing millennium and all that. But nah! Freddie's still sporting vintage violence, as he goes around town, swishing his blade-like fingers and disembowelling pretty young things in their bed, baths and backyards. And as he chases them to their final encounter, he growls and grunts sweet nothings which are barely audible over the screams. If that's not reason enough to give you the chills, there's Kreuger's crumbling-cookie face to make your insides churn.<br>
<br>
So, Freddie Kreuger ko gussa kyon aata hai? Is he actually a simple school gardener who was falsely accused of a crime he never committed and charred to death by a gang of vicious parents? Or is he the quintessential bad guy who can't have enough of crime and violence, not even after his death. Now that's left for two scared young things -- Rooney (Nancy Holbrooke) and Kyle (Quentin Smith) -- to discover, as they desperately try to evade sleep and death, in that order. But hey, there's little our Freddie hunters can do, when the killer has the ability to jump out from nowhere, even if it happens to be the bath tub, the wall paper, the mirror....Watch out for the climax. Sure to make you jump.<br>
<br>
The new version of the classic horror film may not be a revisionist tale and have anything new to offer. Nevertheless, it does have some old fashioned scares that still work and a vintage villain (Jackie Earle Haley) whose sword-scissor hands and snarling visage is both fun and fearful.<br>
<br>
Beat the blazing summer heat with some creepy chills. Bring on the Nightmare.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> It's 1954. Everything's not right at the Ashecliffe Asylum that houses the criminally insane on the isolated Shutter Island. US Marshal Ted Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) arrives from Boston after a boat ride on the choppy waters to investigate the mysterious disappearance of one of the inmates from the asylum. But can he hope to uncover the web of intrigue and actually unravel the mysterious going-ons here, specially when he is confronted by a team of hostile doctors, headed by Ben Kingsley and he himself is haunted by disturbing vignettes from his violent past....<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese make a great team. After having swept you off your feet with their masterpiece, The Departed, the duo return with a celluloid rendition of Dennis Lehane's novel which traces the degree of violence that is innate in the human species. Setting his drama in an extreme situation, a state-run-institution for criminals who are essentially ruthless killers, Scorsese poses a teaser: Is the asylum more dangerous than the outside world, where the H-bomb hangs dangerously over a civilisation that has still not forgotten the Nazi atrocities. The US Marshal (Leonardo) is haunted by primarily two memories, as he goes about his investigations. The first being his war record where he waded through heaps of bodies before shooting down a battery of German guards in cold blood and the second vision involves the murder of his three young kids, followed by the violent death of his wife.<br>
<br>
The Marshal has a tough task ahead. On the one hand, he must fight his own personal demons and on the other he must wade through the web of subterfuge and find out if the doctors, headed by Kingsley, are actually using this asylum as a laboratory for kinky stuff: human engineering and all that. The sudden disappearance of his assistant (Mark Ruffalo) further adds to the confusion, as does his deteriorating physical condition.<br>
<br>
This one's a gritty drama, with Scorsese creating some marvellous set pieces where the past intervenes with the present and Leonardo creates a compelling picture of brooding disarray. The film however does get bogged down a bit by its gloomy overtones and its meandering flashbacks which tend to distract. But the sledgehammer climax more than makes up for these minor flaws.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Young Nazneen (Tannishtha Chatterjee) is sent off as a 17-year-old bride from her village in Bangladesh to Brick Lane in East London, after her wedding to the much elder, Chanu (Satish Kaushik). She settles down uncomplainingly to a dull and monotonous life of quiet domesticity with her likeable, yet boring husband and two daughters, until love and passion walk into her life against an incendiary post 9/11 backdrop.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Isn't this the biggest irony of the Indian film distribution system that a film with Indian artists, which has won over sundry fans -- and garnered rave reviews -- the world over, finds a low key release in India, almost after three years? And that too, only in a single city (Mumbai), despite the fact that the film deals with a purely sub-continental issue (the migrant experience) and showcases some towering histrionics by desi talent. Both Satish Kaushik and Tannishtha Chatterjee literally set the screen ablaze with their gentle, restrained and unforgettable portrayals of a mismatched Bangladeshi couple that gradually learn the meaning of love and togetherness, against a backdrop of personal and social turmoil.<br>
<br>
Based on the riveting book by Monica Ali, the film is a fine celluloid adaptation: extremely picturesque, pithy, introspective and not at all verbose. Nazneen's journey begins as a young girl from the backwaters of Bangladesh as her carefree childhood games are suddenly interrupted with her mother's suicide. And then comes the seminal dialogue where the young Nazneen says: Nobody questioned mother's death because if we were allowed to ask questions, God would have made us boys. Hence, the virtue of silence and unquestioning acceptance, as Nazneen passes from girlhood to wifehood and motherhood, without ever experiencing the highs and lows of life. Of course, she has husband Chanu by her side: the good and kind Chanu who quotes Chaucer and Hume and dreams of fitting in as the perfect Brit. But is Chanu her dream man....Indeed, a difficult decision to make, specially when the young firebrand Karim (Christopher Simpson) walks into her lonely afternoons with his quest for the unspoit village girl.<br>
<br>
Watch the film for the grandeur that both Satish Kaushik and Tannishtha Chatterjee invest in their role of the low key couple who try to cope with a changing world order. Satish Kaushik completely reinvents himself as an actor as Chanu, the quintessential nice guy, the eternal optimist and the unflinching liberal. And watch it for its humanist-feminist-non-fundamentalist message.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a ragamuffin picked up from the streets by the Persian King Sharaman for his bravery and daring. He grows up as his son, along with his two foster brothers, Seso and Garsiv and life is a veritable bed of roses until he is sent by his Uncle (Ben Kingley) to plunder the beautiful city of Alamat, ruled by the feisty Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton). This is the beginning of a nefarious plot of treachery and intrigue where the conflict centres around a mystical dagger that has the power of unleashing time travel and world destruction. Who is desperate for the dagger? And who can save the world?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Here comes another end-of-the-world adventure, wrapped up in quintessential Hollywood style, which essentially translates into a larger-than-life desert safari where swords clash, sandstorms rise, intrigue simmers, magic brews and passion soars....Yup! Prince of Persia is a great getaway from the summer ennui and offers you a popcorn crunching two hours of fun and games.<br>
<br>
And why not? For, the film is actually based on a video game that hit the market in 2003 and asks you not to tax your brains at all. All it demands is to sit back and serenade the over-the-top adventure which unfolds in ancient Persia where palace intrigue, shaman mystique and royal romance seemed to be the only thing that mattered. Add to this, a band of gypsy-like mercenaries, led by Alfred Molina and you have all the masala to keep the mercury rising this summer.<pi><br>
<br>
The high point of the film is its stellar ensemble cast headed by Ben Kingsley who lends gravitas to the entire proceedings as Nizam, the King's brother who may have lived all his life in the shadows but remains a dominant figure, nonetheless. Jake Gyllenhaal's Prince of Persia is quite an unusual act too, for the actor has never been as playful and acrobatic before. As for Gemma Arterton's Tamina? Now she's a delicious tease, an oriental bombshell who truly oversteps her Bond girl brief and grows from mere eye candy to a woman of substance. Tamina is the keeper of the magical dagger and is determined to stay in-step with the warrior prince, fighting to save the world as an equal partner, albeit with a yummy pout....Of course, you cannot ignore Alfred Molina as the scruffy Arab ostrich runner with the ragtag band of fighters and marksmen.<br>
<br>
The review wouldn't be complete without a special mention for the arresting canvas of the film, created by some stupendous camera work by John Seale and the Armageddon's-here special effects by Trevor Woods. Total mazaa!</pi>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>It's 2019. A global epidemic has reduced humans to an endangered species and the world seems to be brimming over with vampires who are hunting them down for their precious blood. Who will win the war for plasma? Seems the vampires will, unless Ethan Hawke, a haematologist, finds a solution to the global crisis. He does, by developing a substitute for blood, but not before a bloody battle for survival.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>Vampires again. Only this time, it ain't the handsome teen mutant Twilighters (Robert Pattinson and co.) who are quite welcome with their blood-lusting fangs. Here, the vampires are a bunch of nasty snarlers who brutally pounce on the handful of humans left in this grim-dim scenario and then indulge in some lip-smacking, blood-dripping drama, even as the endangered human race cries out for a saviour.<br>
<br>
So, who's the messiah going to be this time round? Dr Ed Dalton (Ethan Hawke) is the man of the moment. Doesn't matter if he himself is a vampire, because he is a vegetarian blood-sucker, feasting only on animal blood. He develops synthetic blood which has magical powers. It allows humans to survive and vampires who feed on them, to perish. But the benevolent doctor cannot re-build the human race without the help of the crossbow-wielding Elvis (Willem Dafoe) who has his own gory vampire history.<br>

This one's for those who still haven't had their fill of vampire lore which happens to be the current craze in Hollywood and those who like their vampires mostly mean and monster-like.<br>

But he soon begins to miss his family and wants to get back to the present. Is there a way back....<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>Midlife crisis, Shrek (Mike Myers)? Yup. Specially when you are forced to rise and shine everyday with the cheery cackle of your brood; when you must burp and feed them and dabble with ogre shit relentlessly; when you must parrot `Ever After' each time wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz) mumbles `Happily' on the dinner table; when you can't snooze in your favourite chair because high-spirited friends, Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss (Antonio Banderas) want to spent some quality buddy time with you.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Robert Pattinson is a rebellious NYU student who's walked out on his rich daddy (Pierce Brosnan) after a family tragedy. He is able to connect only with his younger sister and his roomie and generally drifts through his daily routine, until he meets Emilie de Ravin, another grief-stricken girl who has her own ways with coping with personal loss. Romance blooms, albeit in a bitter sweet way....<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>Robert Pattinson fans, don't miss this one. The vampire truly comes of age and showcases a bite that doesn't necessarily spring from his fangs. No, this time, it's his tingling portrait of an angst-ridden young New Yorker, who prefers to slum it out rather than live with his rich, successful, yet insensitive dad (Pierce Brosnan) which creates an impact. Gone is Edward Cullen's mere beefcake appeal which is replaced by a moody, enigmatic charisma of a twenty-one year old who's still looking for meaning and motive to anchor his life.<br>
<br>
And strangely, he shares a better chemistry here with co-brooder Emilie de Ravin than he does with his human girl friend (Kristen Stewart) in the Twilight series. What begins as a revenge relationship -- Pattinson befriends de Ravin to avenge her cop dad (Chris Cooper) -- gradually transmutes into something infinitely tender and gossamer-like. The duo discover each other slowly, through sundry strange encounters, in the dimly lit streets of New York and the crummy interiors of Pattinson's student apartment. It doesn't take them long to realise that grief and a troubled past isn't the only thing that binds them together. Gradually, they end up soothing out the rough edges in each others lives and rebuild broken bridges with estranged family. If Pattinson manages to re-connect with his abrasive lawyer dad, then de Ravin returns to her overbearing dad (Chris Cooper) who hasn't been able to forgive himself for having failed to protect his wife from a bunch of subway muggers. And then comes the climax!<br>
<br>
Set against 9/11, Remember Me is an immensely watchable romance, even as it paints a touching picture of loss and redemption against a violence-scarred backdrop. Raise a toast for RPatz.

<strong>Movie Review: </strong>Sweet, sentimental and harmless fun, this rom-com gently cruises along the usual path of candle-lit romance, bedroom encounters, lover's brawls, passionate re-unions and some humour too, with a support group of single mothers trying to have fun in no-man's land.<br>

Jennifer Lopez thinks she's got her life all neatly planned out with her pet shop, her disabled pet (an adorable dog), her spunky nana and her decision to be a single mother who buys a sperm off the shelf simply because she believes there are no perfect men left. Little does she know that life ain't exactly a bundle of neat plans. All the order in her life goes for a toss when she meets the hunky cheese farmer who sells goat cheese at a neighbourhood farmer's market and proposes to set up shops that sell local food only.

<strong>Movie Review: </strong>If you read Nicholas Spark, (he's written the script) you'd know what you're going to end up with in this father-daughter tale of re-bonding. Loads of heart-warming moments and lots and lots of mushy sentimentality....<br>
<br>
But more than Spark, the film is primarily meant to showcase the histrionics of the 17-year-old Hannah Montana star. And to be honest, Miley does acquit herself well as the young Ronnie who not only saves the turtles from the raccoons, romps in the beach, has mud baths with her boyfriend (Liam Hemsworth) but also manages to re-connect with her troubled father (Greg Kinnear) who writes a special musical composition for her. And yes, you guessed right. In a teary sequence, our musical prodigy may not get to sing, but she does get to re-discover her musical roots and completes the composition that dad wrote for her.<br>

<strong>Movie Review: </strong>If Iron Man was introspective, interspersed with high octane action sequences, then Iron Man 2 is completely over the top and no apologies for that.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Shabana Azmi is a worried mom. She wants to get her frumpy, overweight daughter married before she joins her dear departed husband in heaven. But there seem to be no boys willing to marry her girl and her hopes begin to sag, until she finds the desi cop, Senthil Ramamurthy taking an undue interest in the jalebi-guzzling girl, even as the city is rocked by a series of serial killings....<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Statutory warning: Please do not go expecting another genre-bending cinematic experience from the filmmaker who gave us Bend it Like Beckham, that gem of a film that became a Bible for almost any and every young girl aspiring to fly over the gender bind. This time round, Gurinder Chadha doesn't manage to hold up a crackling mirror to the desi experience of growing up in phoren soil, despite anchoring her story once again in a Punjabi family that tries to cling to the Indian way of life in old Blighty.<br>
<br>
Also, don't go expecting laughs all the way. Because, unlike Bend it...there isn't much to tickle the funny bone here. The humour is sparse and the comedy bordering on the uncanny. Like, are we really supposed to laugh at the interaction of a serial killer with her victims who have been killed with an overdose of curry, kebabs, nans, rolling pins, rat poison and even a pair of garden scissors. Okay, so the victims may be Blithe Spirits who have forgiven her and can even weep for her unmarried daughter, but come on, she is the infamous `curry killer' who has been haunting the streets, isn't she! More importantly, she's been bumping people off simply because they rejected her daughter. Funny, anybody? All of the portly Mrs Sethi's (Shabana Azmi) dark circles and desperate widow status don't end up making this an uproarious black comedy.<br>
<br>
Then again, is the over-the-top climax supposed to set us rolling in the aisles? Understandably, it's supposed to be an inspired Asian spoof on the climax of the cult horror film, Carrie. But Sally Hawkin's psychic attack with tandoori chicken missiles and samosa shrapnel hardly stands up to Sissy Spacek's horrific blood-drenched revenge on prom night.<br>
<br>
All in all, It's a Wonderful Afterlife is essentially a bundle of missed opportunities. The filmmakers wanted to unleash a gentle laugh at themselves -- the burgeoning Asian community in Britain which still hangs on to moribund Indian traditions when it comes to girls and marriage. Every Indian-born mother obsesses about her daughter's (Goldy Notay) wedding to a well-settled NRI munda. For a mother like Shabana Azmi, it becomes the sole reason for her entire existence, so much so, it even leads her to murder. She cannot conceive of leaving her daughter unwed, despite the fact that she's an independent young girl who believes singleton is also a valid state to be in. And the fact that her daughter's India-returned best friend (Sally Hawkins) has managed to find a desi beau, despite being a firangi, only adds to her woes. Of course, Hawkin's marriage -- to Jimmi Mistry -- is merely an extension of her touristy affair with India, but mum can't see that. Also, she's more bothered about the young and handsome cop (Senthil Ramamurthy) who has begun to make frequent visits to their house. Could he be the answer to her prayers for her daughter? Don't fat girls deserve a chance too? Must a moustached upper lip matter more than a woman's good-natured heart?<br>
<br>
Nice questions, all these, but not so nattily answered. It's a Wonderful Afterlife could have...would have...should have...but all it does is end up as average fare: Indian curry yes, yet minus the tangy flavour. Also, the actors don't really get to grow on you, which is quite sad, since Shabana Azmi might just have set the screen on fire, if she knew what her brief was: to make us laugh or cry! Goldy shows promise and Senthil? Well, Senthil just looks good.<br>
<br>
A word about:<br>
Performances: Sadly, the characters aren't well fleshed out and don't know if they are supposed to play it straight or funny. Shabana disappoints, despite the fact that she's specially put on weight for this role. Goldy Notay is watchable, while Senthil Ramamurthy doesn't have much to do. Yes, he does get to remove his shirt in a scene!<br>
<br>
Story: Scripted by Paul Mayeda Berges and Gurinder Chadha, the film tries to document the Asian experience in Britain. However, it merely skims through it.<br>
<br>
Music: The audio track is indeed a winner. Directed by Bally Sagoo and Sukhwinder, the music of the film is a vibrant mish-mash of bhangra, pop, hip hop and English songs too to appeal to the Indian diaspora. Watch out for the Sukhwinder and Rahat Fateh Ali number.<br>
<br>
Inspiration: The pre-climax party scene has been lifted from the cult classic, Carrie. But what was supposed to be a spoof isn't really funny.

But dad begins to feel the robot is no substitute for his son and rejects him. Enter, Astro Boy, the lonely machine who tries to prove he actually belongs to the human world, and ends up a hero.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>Don't underestimate the importance of Astro Boy. Firstly because it's an animated feature that manages to work despite steering clear of the demands of 3D: dark glasses and all that fuss. And secondly, it tells a story of courage, friendship and family-bonding simply, sweetly, even as it creates a boy-hero who is bound to curry favour with all those little boy-heroes in your family.<br>
<br>
Based on the iconic manga created in the 1950s by Osamu Tezuka, the Japanese boy wonder dons a stylish big screen avatar. Rejected by the human world, he creates a poignant picture, primarily because he has the memories and the mindset of Toby, a human boy who was loved and protected by his scientist dad (Nicholas Cage), before his untimely death in a robotic experiment. Naturally then, he feels an outsider in the heartless mecha world too and is unable to connect with the mean machines on Earth, after his fall from Metropolis, the glitzy, hi-tech city in the sky. He does manage to find a few friends amongst the vagabond kids who scavenge for scrap robots for their Fagin-like Godfather, but that doesn't stop him from longing for his dad. Can he hope for a reunion? Maybe he can, if he uses his special powers and saves Metropolis from the megalomania of the evil President (Donald Sutherland).<br>
<br>
Astro Boy, with its colourful animation and its dramatic voice-overs is perfect weekend fare for kids who need a break from the violent games on play station.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Three Florida houseflies are completely bored on their garbage dump. They decide to pep up their lives by flying to the moon and end up as stowaways on Apollo 11. But their heroic adventure is frowned upon by a bunch of Russian flies who begin to plot their downfall in classic US versus Russia political hostility.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>Supposedly the first Hollywood animation feature in 3D (it's a 2008 film), Fly Me To The Moon is a sassy adventure film, with a political underpinning. Of course, the politics of the film may be lost on the young audience but for the adults who accompany them, the conflict between the three American astronaut flies and the envious Russian winged villain, Yegor does have enough fire power to keep the drama zingy.<br>
<br>
But the story essentially belongs to the natty pre-teen, Nat and his buddies, IQ and Scooty, who create a fly-sized rocket in a field across Cape Canaveral, the launch pad for Apollo 11. Nat is inspired by his grandfather who supposedly saved Amelia Earhart as she flew across the Atlantic on her historic flight and has brought his grandfly up on a credo that declares that dreamers don't actually end up getting swatted....<br>
<br>
It doesn't take long for Nat to realise his dreams can't take wings on a fly-sized rocket. They need something bigger, like the helmets of the astronauts aboard Apollo 11. The friends hitch-hike a flight into outer space by sneaking into the helmets of Aldrin, Armstrong and Collins and make history of their own. Nat even manages to set wings on the moon as he is the lucky fly who buzzes in Armstrong's helmet and the threesome end up as heroes by preventing a short circuit in the space ship. And what do they get for all their troubles? No flies aboard: declares Aldrin on TV after touching back on Earth! Actually, he meant there were no flies on board the real flight. Ha-ha!<br>
<br>
A fun film, with picturesque animation, Fly Me To The Moon is great time-pass.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Synopsis:</strong> Gerard Butler, an ex-cop who chases fugitives for reward money, has a new assignment. This time, the bounty hunter must bring in his ex-wife to jail for jumping bail in a minor crime. Does the ex-couple rekindle their romance on this cat-and-mouse journey that sees them getting embroiled in a crime drama too?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> First things first. Do Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston set the screen on fire with their chemistry? Nope, they don't. Not like Eva Mendes and Will Smith did in Tennant's earlier rom-com, Hitch. Aniston keeps raising her eyebrows and Butler wears a sardonic sneer on his lips amidst the constant sparring that happens between the two. This does make you laugh, now and then, but it doesn't really raise the mercury to boiling point.<br>
<br>
So, settle down for a temperate, time-pass comedy as the odd couple discover that its the oddity (read mismatch) that is essentially the highpoint of their relationship. And divorce hasn't managed to dull the ardour, despite the apparent negative vibes between them. Of course, it takes long car rides, where Jennifer must spend most of her time either in the trunk or in handcuffs, and a visit to their honeymoon hotel to make them realise this simple truth. Not forgetting a brush with corrupt cops, shooters and gunmen....Aniston's an investigative reporter, you see, chasing some hot story in high-heels. Doesn't take long for Butler to become her assistant on the beat.<br>
<br>
Funny in places, feisty here and there, The Bounty Hunter, is one more middle-of-the-road outing from Jennifer Aniston.

Terrorists have captured the Chernobyl nuclear reactor and are threatening to unleash a radioactive cloud with the help of their own custom-made Universal Soldier who is essentially a killing machine. Can he combat the invincible Van Demme too?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> When Universal Soldier first released, it was a different world. Action was a simpler word in Hollywood lexicon. Small wonder then Jean Claude Van Demme became an instant hit with his robotic zeal to kill and kill alone, minus unnecessary small talk. Today, we live in a post 9/11 world where violence has a whole new definition, both in the real and reel world.<br>
<br>
Big question? Do Van Demme's antics actually strike a chord anymore. Nah! They don't, specially when he himself has to have all those steroid shots in his arms, neck and other body parts and work out on the treadmill before he can take on another like him. So what if he does manage to save the world from a nuclear disaster and spill a lot of blood. In the end it's all ketchup and kitsch.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Synopsis:</strong> Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan are the most unusual NYPD cop buddys. They almost always end up in trouble. But this time, the trouble gets personal when Willis loses his priceless baseball card in a heist. He wanted to sell the card to marry off his daughter. The search for the card leads them to a crazy Mexican gang. The rest is mayhem....<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> It's crude. It's rude. And it's downright funny, but only in a down and out way. Bruce Willis sure has come a long way from his Diehard days to replay a cop, albeit in Cop Out style. His NYPD detective act as Jimmy Monroe is in stark contrast to his singlet-wearing, no-nonsense officer John McClane in the Diehard series. But hey, no need to go in for comparisons, are they? Just sit back and have some silly fun as Jimmy teams up with the loud, brattish and uncouth Paul (Tracy Morgan) to bust up a Mexican gang and get back his rare baseball card.<br>
<br>
Most of the humour is left to Tracy Morgan who chooses to play it from below the belt. Sometimes he succeeds, sometimes he doesn't. But most of the time, he does have you laughing, even as Willis tries to keep a straight face through it all. The fact that Morgan's unsure of his wife's fidelity only adds to the problem and makes him more testosterone-strung. Add to that a beautiful stowaway who has a language problem and a fetish for chocolate men and you know there's going to be chaos.<br>

He soon realises he is on a wild goose chase and is just a mere puppet in America's grand design to overthrow the Iraqi regime on a false pretext. When the officers of the Pentagon refuse to accept the truth, he leaks it out to the press. Does he end up as a hero, a patriot or a trouble-maker?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Based on the book, Imperial Life in the Emerald City by Washington Post journalist Rajiv Chandrasekaran, Green Zone is an important film that questions the entire US offensive in Iraq which began on the pretext of destroying the WMDs. But as it turns out, and as Sergeant Roy Miller (Matt Damon) discovers, there are no weapons of mass destruction to be found. So what's the war for? And why has an entire country been turned to rubble?<br>
<br>
And in case, there's still room for doubt on the part of some diehard US patriots, the film maker uses his Iraqi protagonist to state the seminal truth: It is not for you decide what happens in this country, the local tells Damon. The film has been touted as the fourth Jason Bourne film, since it brings together the same team of Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon and uses a similar narrative technique of dizzy camera angles, breathless chase sequences and the fast cut.<br>

A forewarning: don't go looking for the Bourne effect and you'll enjoy the relevance of this film which dares to question and debate.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Snehamoy, a school teacher in a small village in the Sunderbans, finds a penpal in the Japanese girl, Miyage, who runs a grocery store in Japan. The duo build a beautiful relationship and even marry through an exchange of letters. Sadly, it remains a long-distance relationship, since the two are unable to meet due to the constraints of their personal life. But, that does not affect their love or the depth of their feelings, despite the presence of the beautiful widow, Sandhya in Snehamoy's life.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> If you really care about aesthetics and have been hungering for something that will satiate your finer sensibilities -- battered by now, by the relentless onslaught of kitsch -- you must grab a dekko at Aparna Sen's artful rendition of Kunal Basu's novel, The Japanese Wife. There is such beauty, restraint and minimalism in this akin-to-a-haiku film, it transports you into another world altogether. One, where love can exist without consummation and togetherness can be attained, despite spatial and cultural distances.<br>
<br>
Snehamoy (Rahul Bose) and Miyage (Chigusa Takaku) build an everlasting bond through a mere exchange of letters that manage to communicate their devotion and longing for each other, even though they both are unsure of their English and are bred in totally different cultures. But Snehamoy connects with his distant wife by flying the beautiful kites she sends him and Miyage dons the bangles and drinks the medicine her husband posts to her, hoping that someday they might be physically together....It's an unconventional yet undeniable bond that is accepted by all and sundry: by Snehamoy's vivacious aunt (Moushumi Chatterjee), who does get hysterical initially, by Sandhya, the silent and adoring widow (Raima Sen) and her young son who seek shelter with Snehamoy and by the villagers too. And yet, like the mercurial landscape of the Sunderbans, it's a bonding that is not without its turbulence too: unfulfilled passion, deep desire, desperate longing....<br>
<br>
Watch out for a new-look Rahul Bose, who pitches in a powerhouse performance, complete with Bengali English, as the laidback Snehamoy, the vibrant Moushumi Chatterjee, the poignant Raima Sen, sweet little Chigusa and then savour Anay Goswami's superb cinematography, which paints landscapes on celluloid. Truly, this one's a heady potion from Aparna Sen...can still feel the senses clouding!<br>
<br>
A word about:<br>
<br>
Performances: Rahul Bose is in stellar form with his village boy look and his Bangla Angrezi. Raima Sen is delectable as the reticent, shy widow and Moushumi Chatterjee is a revelation.<br>
<br>
Screenplay: Kunal Basu's book has been superbly adapted for a celluloid rendition.<br>
<br>
Cinematography: Anay Goswami's camera creates visual poetry even as it captures the wild Sunderbans in all their devastating fury.<br>
<br>
Inspiration: The film is based on Kunal Basu's book, The Japanese Wife.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Sergeant William James joins an elite corp of American soldiers in Iraq as the bomb defuser. He spends most of his time in dangerous territory, swathed in protective battle gear, trying to defuse human and car bombs, while his team tries to protect him from snipers and mysterious locals who trigger off the remote-controlled bombs. The film explores the effect of this daily tryst with death on the psyche of young soldiers, trapped in a political battle that seems to be heading nowhere....<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The film takes off from a statement by Chris Hedges, a war correspondent for the New York Times. After having studied the psyche of the young American soldiers on battleground Iraq, Hedges declared: 'The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction; for war is a drug.' A drug potent enough to de-humanise, de-sensitise the participants and transform them into killing machines? Or a drug, just strong enough to infuse that degree of adrenalin rush that is required to give you the courage to relentlessly court death through death-defying tasks like defusing bombs, chasing snipers, clearing mines, escaping suicide bombers....<br>
<br>
The beauty of Bigelow's film lies in the middle-of-the-road path it traverses. It may not be an overtly anti-war film like James Cameron's Avatar; yet, it surely isn't a pro-war film that unabashedly celebrates America's foreign policy offensive in alien lands. It is a thinker's film, that forces you to ponder on both the necessity and futility of violence in the modern world.<br>
<br>
There's a poignant -- and thought provoking scene -- at the end of the film where Sgt James (Jeremy Renner), who has defused 800 plus bombs, says he doesn't know why he does it. 'Do you know why I don't know why?' he asks his team mate Sgt Sanborn (Anthony Mackie). 'I don't know why,' replies an equally confused Sanborn. Touching and truly reflective of the futility and inevitability of war! Again, when James' dare-devilry and job expertise causes his senior to ask him what's the best way to defuse bombs, James crisply declares: 'the best way is the way to remain alive!' Of course, our hero is scared, vulnerable and does question his daily routine (relentlessly disentangling wires that could trigger off his death) even though he seems to get a high going through it, with apparent nonchalance, recklessness and fearlessness.<br>
<br>
While his bomb defusing heroics are nerve-wracking and truly tense, some of the best parts of the film lie in James' interaction with the people around him. With the rest of the boys, he plays rough games; but with young Beckham, the local boy who sells pirated DVDs, he plays football. Add to this, the edgy overtones of the film which unfolds like a thriller, the questioning tenor of the screenplay and the brilliant cinematography where Barry Ackroyd suitably transforms Jordan into battle zone Iraq, and you have a film that deserves all the six Oscars it recently grabbed.<br>
<br>
Don't miss this topical teaser of a film that dares to go inside the mind of the young soldier who is herded into the battle field, without actually knowing why. It could trigger off a debate on newage desh-bhakti....<br>
<br>
A word about:<br>
<br>
Performances: The boyz are brilliant, specially Jeremy Renner who beautifully blends cockiness with fear; bellicosity with introspection.<br>
<br>
Screenplay: Mark Boal, who wrote the screenplay, was embedded with an American squad in Baghdad. It shows.<br>
<br>
Dialogue: Soldier talk, all the way, with hard-hitting provocative teasers on the relevance of war thrown in.<br>
<br>
Cinematography: Barry Ackroyd's camera captures the terror and the grime from intensely close quarters. Quite scary, specially when it pans on human bombs.

The only person who can stop Hades, the God of the underworld from his evil plan is Perseus, the half-man, half-god hero who happens to be the son of Zeus, the King of Gods and the ruler of Mount Olympus.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>The super heroes have had their say. The wizards and hobbits have done it too. the ordinary mortal has flexed his muscles. The man-machine has also tried to bend the matrix. Now, it seems to be the turn of a new kind of hero who must save the world from impending doom: the demi-god.<br>
<br>
After Percy Jackson, we have Perseus (Sam Worthington), the messiah who, as the film insists, combines the best of man and god and has a responsibility that seems to be even greater than the gods. He must save the entire human race from the wrath of renegade gods, like Hades (Ralph Fiennes), without succumbing to the allurements of super gods -- and super dads -- like Zeus (Liam Neeson). In the midst of his arduous battles, Zeus offers Perseus the opportunity to leave it all behind and cross over, to become the ruler of Olympus. Apna Perseus politely refuses. He prefers to be a man and serve mankind, he confesses. Clap, clap!<br>
<br>
The film maybe a re-make of the 1980s film. But it actually doesn't feel dated. Firstly because it is so much like playstation push-button fantasies. And secondly because the entire drama is an explosion of special effects and digital exuberance which bring to life larger-than-life monsters and creatures cavorting in an exotic landscape. The core of the film is essentially the three battles which Perseus and his ragtag army of bedraggled men fight for survival. The first is with a giant scorpion, which seems indestructible, the second, with the slithery Medusa in her secret lair and the third with Kraken, the gangster god's last weapon which seems to be a strange mix of T-Rex and Godzilla. Needless to say, all this is nail-biting, popcorn- gobbling stuff.<br>
<br>
A word about the 3D effects however. This time, it seems to be an after thought, which means, there's hardly anything that reaches out to you threateningly, as it did in Avatar. In fact, the only thing common with the SFX super storm, Avatar, is the presence of Sam Worthington. So, don't go looking for a similar blitzkreig and you might get the requisite bang for your buck.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>The film explores the early years of Queen Victoria, England's longest reigning monarch, years before she became the Empress of India too. The core of the historical biograph is the romance between a twenty-something Victoria and the Belgian prince Albert who remained the love of her life (and husband) for just 21 years (1840-1861).<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>Most period films tend to distance the protagonist from the viewer, specially if they deal with royalty. Too much pomp and ostentation creates a kind of chasm that seems difficult to bridge. But not so with The Young Victoria.<br>
<br>
The high point of the film is that it manages to present the British monarch like any other rebellious young girl. Victoria (Emily Blunt) is forced to grow up in cloistered surroundings, stifled by a million dos and don'ts and, like any other teenager, she turns up her nose at restrictions, throws tantrums and tries to break as many rules as she can. Of course, she isn't always successful, but she does manage to marry the man of her choice, after a long courtship, which unfolds through an exchange of sweet -- and sensible -- letters interspersed with discussions on Schubert. The romance between Victoria and Albert (Rupert Friend) proceeds languorously and is punctuated by another interesting track: her friendship -- or is it attraction -- with Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), the wily politician who is forced to surrender his characteristic wheeling-dealing before her innocence and charm.<br>
<br>
The film managed to grab an Oscar for Best Costume and is worth a dekko.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>In a post apocalyptic world, Eli, a lone ranger, walks Westwards with the only surviving copy of the St. James Bible. His mission is to find a safe and civilized place for the holy book. But will the evil dictator Carnegie (Gary Oldman) let him pass through the ravaged, brutal landscape, specially when he is himself desperate for the book which will help him rule over the world with the power of faith.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>Now this one's truly a surprise. It is the first full blown Hollywood film which spills over with an unabashed religiosity. Mainstream films have by and large been secular and non-theocratic, keeping religion out of the fray unless it's a biographical film like The Passion Of Christ. But the Hughes Brothers not only advocate a return to Christianity, they also showcase it as the only religion that can form the basis of any civilised society. For, 30 years after the end of the world, the only surviving bunch of erudite men realise they can rebuild civilisation only after retrieving the Bible and reprinting it. In fact, even the rogue despot (Gary Oldman) knows he can expand his rag tag empire with the power of the Bible alone.<br>
<br>
However, he also knows laying his hands on it isn't going to be easy, since the book-keeper happens to be the invincible Eli (Denzel Washington). Much as he would try to label him as just another man, Carnegie knows that Eli is the new age messiah who cannot be felled by bullet or slayed by a sword. All his efforts to extract the book from the fearless traveller end up in vain as Eli is not only adept in reciting the verses from the Holy Book in a faithless world, he is equally skilled in the art of man slaughter. And why not? For the post-apocalyptic terrain is one helluva place, hounded by cannibals and brutes. Definitely not a nice place for a sweet young thing like Mila Kunis who is determined to be on the road with God-like Eli. She needs to escape the terror reign of Oldman and his oddballs who have already reduced her blind mother (Jennifer Beals) to a bundle of nerves.<br>
<br>
The overriding religiosity of the film and the salutation to the West as the bowl of civilisation might put off many an Oriental viewer. But don't let this detract from from the viewability of the film which is essentially an extremely well-shot action drama, embellished with some fine performances by Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman as high-powered adversaries. Treat it as a good versus evil fable, and The Book of Eli works excellently. And yes, do note that Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code has no value in the new world. Oldman summarily declares it should be burned. Wonder what a certain bestselling author has to say about that!

She manages to rise above a lack lustre script and give it some bounce with her balsy act of an upscale, ambitious, hard-headed business woman who discovers she's actually all heart. What brings about this change in her is a bunch of small town people who believe it isn't the fireplace that actually keeps people warm. Nah! for them, it's human emotions that matter the most, even if it means befriending seemingly offensive people, like Ms Zellweger, who doesn't think twice before hurting and stinging all and sundry.<br>
<br>
Sent to cold and snowy Minnesota to hand out some pink slips, the lady in high heels however soon learns to come down to ground level. All it takes is a bit of tapioca pudding, a few family dinners with her homely assistant and some night outs with the antsy trade unionist, Harry Connick Jr who has a 13-year-old daughter with a bad hair day.<br>
<br>
An inconsequential love story, New in Town acquires body and form only because of Ms Zellweger. Watch it as time-pass. It could make you smile on an average day.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Based on the 1982 Broadway musical which won the Tony award, Nine is a biographical account of film maker Fellini. The musical itself was a stage version of Fellini's landmark film 8 1/2 and captures the film maker's angst as he tries to cope with writer's block while making a new film.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>Creativity never comes easy. Now that's a cliche everybody knows. But to actually watch it on screen or stage, gives it an entirely new perspective. Living through the mental agony of Guido Contini as he tries to cope with the pressures of living up to his reputation of an ace Italian film maker helps you unravel the extreme highs and lows of a disorderly, free-spirited life wedded to the arts.<br>
<br>
Surely, it isn't easy being Italy's number one film maker, is it? On the one hand, Guido's professional life is in a tizzy, as he tries to meet the producer's deadlines and write a relevant script that must end up as another masterpiece. All this, while his inspiration has hit an all-time low.<br>
<br>
On the other, there are the sundry entanglements of his personal life, marred by a web of high-strung relationships and the pressures of a strictly Catholic upbringing that frowns on his libertine ways. So Guido tries to find a way out of the maze by meeting up with priests and cardinals on one side and all the women in his life on the other. While the priests castigate him for his sexual permissiveness, the women -- his wife (Marion Cottilard), his mistress (Penelope Cruz), his muse (Nicole Kidman), his mother (Sophia Loren) -- all want their share of him. Enough to drive Guido into a frenzy....Needless to say, Guido is actually Fellini.<br>
<br>
Nine may not be as engrossing as Rob Marshall's other mind-bending musical, Chicago. Nevertheless, it is an enchanting experience with Daniel Day Lewis trying hard to match up to the towering talent of Marcello Mastroianni who left an indelible impact as Guido in Fellini's film, 8 1/2. Amongst the women, it's Marion Cottilard as his suffering wife and Penelope Cruz as his desperate mistress that stand out. Pamper yourself with this Italian song-dance soiree.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Alice runs away from her wedding and returns to Wonderland, once again. This time, she realises she must set things right in the strange land by siding up with the White Queen and putting an end to the Red Queen's reign of terror. Aiding her in her crusade are the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Caterpillar and several others.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Tim Burton has a characteristic cinematic vision that completely defies the stereotype. Whatever be the story, this maverick film maker doesn't really believe in telling it straight. With Alice in Wonderland too, you might find the characters do emerge from the pages of Lewis Carroll's landmark book, but their contours, colours and contortions are all their own.<br>
<br>
Hence, you have Alice (Mia Wasikowska), a runaway bride, going down the rabbit hole once again, in order to escape from an inconvenient marriage. You have the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) who doesn't only wear green mascara, he also wears his heart on his sleeve. Hear him tell Alice softly she needn't go back to the world above, and your heart almost melts. And then, there's the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), a ruler who doesn't know whether it is better to be loved or feared. Do we hate her or do we pity her? Can't say. Or, more importantly, is she really mean, with her murderous `Off with their heads!' chant or is she just a victim of loneliness, isolation and rejection. After all, she must have had a difficult life growing up grotesque and ugly, with a bulbous head, alongside her beautiful sister, the White Queen (Anne Hathaway). Also, there are the bunch of animated characters who breathe life into the film with their fantastic forms and their excellent voice-overs. Our favourites being the spooky Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry), now visible, now gone, the erudite, hookah-smoking Caterpillar (Alan Rickman) and Bayard (Timothy Spall), the limpid-eyed dog who is forced to do stuff he doesn't like, because the wicked queen holds his wife and pups captive.<br>
<br>
Indeed, the parade of characters is extremely colourful, as is the canvas, which literally explodes in frame after frame of sheer art. The landscape of Wonderland, designed by Robert Stromberg of Avatar fame, is truly wondrous and leaves you gasping, time and again. The almost surrealistic spiritualism of the White Queen's kingdom stands out in stark contrast to the dark mystery and the gaudy hysteria of the Red Queen's world. The Mad Hatter's tea party is a sheer delight, as are Alice's encounter with the Cheshire Cat. And above all there is the universal battle of good over evil, which culminates in a dramatic finale where Alice must summon hidden reserves of courage to slay the demonic Jabberwocky.<br>
<br>
The evergreen fable comes alive in mesmeric form. Don't miss your tryst with a dapper Johnny Depp, a newage Alice and an over-the-top Tim Burton.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Aaron Eckhart, a self-help guru, helps people cope with grief. Ironically, this bestselling author and motivational speaker himself needs to come to terms with his wife's untimely death. Will the chance encounter with florist, Jennifer Aniston, help him face his fears and emerge a free man?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>This one's serious business. Much of the romance between Jennifer Aniston and Aaron Eckhart proceeds on a sombre note, with both our protagonists trying to cope with their personal tragedies.<br>
<br>
Motivational guru, Eckhart may have authored the bestseller, A-Okay, but he's actually on the run from his own life -- and his own people -- marred by an accident that killed his wife. Aniston, on the other hand, may be decorating hotels with exotic blooms, but her personal life is thorny and shrivelled, having just suffered heartbreak. So, when the antsy Ms Aniston and the escapist Mr Eckhart come together, it takes a while for them to shed the awkward baggage of the past, before they can actually begin to bond. Till then, we are made to sit through a few awkward dates, followed by a series of outbursts and a bit of interpersonal therapy, that includes setting a parrot free.<br>
<br>
Actually, it's all quite cute and comfy. As long as the popcorn lasts. Needless to say, Ms Aniston still needs a film that will live up to her Friends stature. Can't think of any film role that stands up to the ebullient Rachel.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Nelson Mandela, released after serving 24 years in prison, becomes South Africa's first black president. Indeed, an arduous task which he begins by building the national rugby team first and inspiring it to win the World Cup in 1995, under the captainship of Francois Pienaar.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Invictus is inspiring political cinema which aptly shows how the difficult task of nation-building isn't about delivering fiery speeches alone. And the fact that it showcases a slice of history from the life and times of one of the most inspirational figures in history, Nelson Mandela, makes it almost epical in nature. The film aptly depicts that governments and politicians don't need to pronounce policy and push files to create cohesive national states. They need to propagate an idea instead, one that binds the nation stronger than any external adhesive or empty rhetoric.<br>
<br>
When Mandela takes over as President, he inherits a nation that is torn asunder by race and colour. The first friction occurs at the very onset when the hardliner ANC guards have an ego clash with the Akrikaner cops and must learn how to dissolve their differences and guard the President together. The Prez knows it's time for forgiveness and reconciliation, but how does he deliver this message to the people and usher in a new era? One day, he spots the country's rugby team on television, learns of its dismal history and decides it's time to create history. How long till the World Cup? he asks. A year, he's told. Enough time to give his nation a symbol they can rally around, despite the baggage of history and the colour of their skin. He meets the team, which comprises all white members and just one black player, and tells them to win the first Rugby World Cup for South Africa. It's an idea which not only inspires the team but sees the captain, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) visit Mandela's prison cell in Robben Island and share the icon's favourite poem which saw him through the bone-breaking and bleak years of rock crunching behind the prison walls.<br>
<br>
Like all sports films, Invictus mostly lives through its nail-biting matches, including the thrilling climax where the national team must face New Zealand which has just defeated the Japanese team by 90 points. But more than the edge-of-the-seat excitement, it's the character of Mandela that towers on screen. Morgan Freeman creates an unforgettable 'Madiba', who is iconic without being larger-than-life. Matt Damon's Francois is perfectly pitched too: overawed by being touched by history, yet never overtly fawning. But eventually, it is the politics of the film which bowls you over. Like all his films, Clint Eastwood once again creates a searing humanist document that sees a world minus superficial schisms and corrosive differences.<br>
<br>
Invictus is absolutely uplifting cinema.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Tiana is a hard-working black New Orlean's girl who's chasing a dream. She wants to set up a restaurant which would serve her dad's gumbo and works double shifts as a waitress. But one fine day, she's kissed by a frog and before she can pucker up in disgust, she's a frog too. Time to begin her quest to be human again....<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Disney's new animated feature is a delightful revisionist tale. It not only features a black princess in the traditional fairy tale, showcasing the usual white one as a bimbette, it opts for an Indian prince too. Believe it or not, the frog prince goes by the name Naveen and is the archetypal brown Asian. Reason enough for India/Indians to welcome the film with open arms -- and open hearts.<br>
<br>
But more than all this, it is the film that is arresting and engrossing fare. Reworking the frog and the princess story completely, the film sees both the hero and the heroine ending up as a bunch of amphibians who must undertake their metaphorical journey to be human once again. And as they tour the charmed -- and brightly coloured -- forest in search of the blind sorceress who would share her secrets with them, they find two unforgettable friends who accompany them in their life-altering journey. One's the alligator Louis who wants to be human too in order to join the boys for some real jazz and the other's Ray, the firefly, who swears eternal love to Evangelina, the evening star. Add to this the evil voodoo villain, Dr Facilier, who wants Naveen and Tiana to remain frogs forever, and you have a delicious swamp and castle adventure that sets the temperatures rising with its riot of colours, its songs and dances and its state-of-the-art animation.<br>
<br>
Take your kids for it. They'll love the uncluttered, pure animation feel and the fulsome storyline.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Meryl Streep has taken 10 years to get over her divorce with Alec Baldwin who left her for a younger woman. But a chance meeting with her ex sets the old currents into motion once again, as the duo discover the joys of adultery this time. Will the single woman settle down for a complicated relationship with her ex-husband again or will she build a new bond with her architect buddy, Steve Martin?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> There's something about Meryl Streep. Something that makes her Hollywood's must-see diva. Defiant of all stereotyping (did anyone talk about age, here?), she has managed to mesmerise recently with films like The Devil Wears Prada, Mama Mia and Julie and Julia. She carries on her success run with It's Complicated where her rendition of the character of Jane is stupendous, scintillating and totally adorable.<br>
<br>
She's the archetypal middle-aged woman who is proud of her hormones and doesn't see herself as a dust-laden old fogey when it comes to the dating game. Life's still looking up for the fifty-going-on-thirty something who flits between two men with startling alacrity and acumen. First, she ends up in bed with her ex-husband (Alec Baldwin) on her son's graduation day and then, she finds herself sharing a reefer with her architect (Steve Martin) on his graduation party and baking crepes for him in the middle of the night. All this, while her grown-up kids crowd over her lavish dinners or huddle up to come to terms with their parent's now-on, now-off status.<br>
<br>
Nancy Meyer's may truly have a woman's perspective when it comes to story-telling (What Women Want), but her male characters are full of beans too. If Meryl Streep is vibrant and bursting with life as Jane, the somewhat confused and so-very-real woman, both Baldwin and Steve Martin are befitting companions too. Their fears and confusions are as convincing as Streep's chaotic state of mind.<br>
<br>
A mature romance, It's Complicated is sweetly touching and tangy.<br>

<strong>Story:</strong> Young Percy Jackson is a demi-god (son of a god and a human). He is falsely accused of stealing the lightning bolt and must retrieve it before earth is torn asunder by the warring gods. Aiding him in his search for the missing bolt are Annabeth, the daughter of goddess Athena and Satyr, a half-human, half-goat creature.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The film is supposed to be in competition with the Harry Potter series. Let's just say, it offers no competition, even though it's directed by Chris Columbus who directed the initial films in the Potter franchise. And that's primarily because the plot fills you with a sense of deja vu. Based on the first book from Percy Jackson and the Olympians, the five-book young adult series by Rick Riordan, the plot featuring a bunch of demi-god heroes -- kids born out of the coming-together of Greek gods and humans -- fills you with a sense of deja vu. The adventures are similar, the enemies are familiar, the special effects are less effective and the sum total is a film that engages but doesn't shock and awe....So unlike HP!<br>
<br>
Percy a dyslexic kid, fathered by Posiedon, the sea God, is forced to attend half-blood camp (deja vu, didn't we say!) when he is falsely accused by Zeus of stealing a lightning bolt. His mother, a bedraggled human, is kidnapped by weird monsters and sent to Hades, the supernatural underworld, where she is held captive until Percy returns the lightning bolt. And if he fails to do so, the gods will be at war which will send the world into apocalyptic mode, unleashing earthquakes, tornadoes and twisters. All he has to help him are his special skills, his dad's voice and his three friends, demi-goddess Annabeth, goat-man Grover and centaur Pierce Brosnan. Of course, not forgetting the flying shoes and the special pen that metamorphoses into a sword.<br>
<br>
Amongst all the fantastical characters that inhabit the film, we would specially like to mention Uma Thurman as the serpent-haired Medusa who walks away with most of our applause as the svelte meanie. Absolutely delightful. For the rest, a word of caution. Don't go looking for Pottermania and you could have some fun with Percymania now.<br>
<br>
A word about: Performances: Logan Lerman ain't no Daniel Radcliffe just as Brandon T. Jackson isn't Ron and Alexandra Daddario doesn't come close to Hermione.<br>
<br>
Dialogue: Cheesy, uninspired.<br>
<br>
Screenplay: Chris Columbus and Rick Riordan fail to create magic and wizardry on screen. They are however adequately engaging.<br>
<br>
Special effects: Average. Now that's unforgivable in an Avtaar-ed age.<br>
<br>
Inspiration: The film is based on the first book in the five-part series by Rick Riordan.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Ryan Bingham is a high-profile corporate downsizer who spends most of his time in airplanes, travelling to offices all over the US and firing people without depressing them. He is the proverbial loner who suddenly discovers there's more to life than rootlessness, pink slips and the anonymity of flying business class. Will he finally settle down?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The beauty of Up In The Air lies in its immense topicality. Rooted in the present continuous, the film takes up the most pressing concern of today's corporate culture -- downsizing -- and dares to look at what lies behind the dreaded pink slips. In short, who are the people (are they heartless souls?) who hand out the pink slips and who are the people who are handed the pink slips (do they all jump off bridges?). But the film isn't about corporate ethics alone. It is essentially an incisive look into the mores of modern living where success, independence and white-collared wonderment have become synonymous with `a cocoon of self-banishment' (read isolation, inability to connect and build life-long relationships), as the film maker rightly suggests.<br>
<br>
Based on the novel by Walter Kirn and directed by Jason Reitman who gave us Juno, the revisionist film on teen pregnancy, Up In The Air has George Clooney vying for the Oscars this year. Not forgetting Anna Kendrick too, who is nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Clooney's cool and collected Ryan Bingham is absolutely riveting as he goes about the length and breadth of recession-hit America firing people with his pep talk on `emptying the bagpack' and cutting loose. No body seems to mind losing their jobs after the career transition counsellor, that's what he's called, has delivered the blow, ever so softly and sophisticatedly. Clooney too isn't struck by conscience calls because all he wants to do is fulfil his life's ambition of accumulating 10 million miles, flying to different destinations. A complete nomad, he savours his disconnect and hates any form of domesticity. So much so, he asks his young colleague, Natalie (Anna Kendrick) to sell him the idea of marriage. And when she does, with some talk about stability, companionship, kids and family, he doesn't buy the idea at all. Twenty-first century man, did we say!<br>
<br>
But Natalie isn't selling the idea of love and marriage alone. This 23-year-old psychology major is on the verge of putting an end to his airborne odyssey by introducing her new ideas on downsizing. According to her new fangled proposal, companies will cut down on their top heavy travel bills by firing on the internet. Needless to say, Ryan's boss loves the sassy new idea and sets up the two -- Ryan and Natalie -- to spearhead the technological change. Time for a few life's lessons to be exchanged as well between the generation-gapped corporate buddies. Ryan must learn to connect a bit, with family and girl friends, while Natalie must learn the importance of disconnecting, a bit...with unworthy boyfriends.<br>
<br>
A smart script, great performances, witticisms galore, Up In The Air is a humanist document of today's times. Not to be missed at all.<br>
<br>
A word about: Performances: Hard-balled corporate yuppie, Anna Kendrick is adorable as the twenty-something who breaks into tears when her boyfriend leaves her, as is Vera Farmiga who views Clooney as a parenthesis in her life. But the arc light is on Clooney and his craftsmanship as Ryan, the rootless 21st century nomad who discovers the importance of roots.<br>
<br>
Dialogue: Extremely real, crisp, concise and witty.<br>
<br>
Script: Jason Reitman and Sheldon Turner create a screenplay that's brimming over with quotable quotes. Keep your notepad handy.<br>
<br>
Styling: Corporate fashion at its best.<br>
<br>
Inspiration: The film is based on the eminently readable novel by Walter Kirn.

But homecoming ends up as a tryst with a dark family secret about werewolves, violence and full moons. Can he escape unscathed?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The film is supposedly a remake of Lon Chaney's 1941 original. But unfortunately, it ends up as a somewhat insipid retelling of a tale that has had a perennial lure for werewolf -- and all other supernatural beings -- buffs. What's even more ironical is the fact that the film fails to work its manic magic, despite featuring powerful actors like Benicio del Toro and Anthony Hopkins. One would have thought they would double up as the deadliest beasts on screen, but all the fang flashing and talon showing turns up as naught and simply fills you with a sense of deja vu. Nah! neither the dad nor the son actually give you the goosebumps as they fight each other to interpret whether their family legacy actually is about bad wolves or good wolves....<br>
<br>
Benicio returns from the US, hoping to find the killer of his lost brother. But the shadows of the family homestead hold too many secrets, as does his mother's untimely death during his childhood. It doesn't take long before he finds himself in the dungeons, nursing wounds after being bitten by a strange creature that leaps out of nowhere when the moon is full. His only hope in this dismal show is the beautiful Emily Blunt who must save him before it's too late. So what if it means resorting to some gypsy mumbo-jumbo while the dad-son duo settle old scores.<br>
<br>
All the entangling of fangs between del Toro and Hopkins doesn't really help. Because The Wolfman is quite a de-fanged drama and has campy special effects too.

He's just proposed to his partner, Jessica Alba, and she's nodded a yes. Does he manage to make record business on V-Day or are there too many achy-breaky hearts going around....<br>
<br>
The film unfolds like a collage of sundry stories about different people who meet, mate or fall apart before the sun sets on the all-important day. Like, the cynical Jessica Biel who has organised a singleton's party to celebrate the death of romance in a balle-balle restaurant, but ends up finding hope at last: sports commentator, Jamie Foxx. Or else, like the school teacher, Jennifer Garner who chases her boyfriend, Patrick Dempsey, to another town, only to find out he's a two-timer who's happily married. And then, there's the only other memorable story of phone sex talker, Anne Hathaway who must convince her small town, moralistic boy friend there's more to her than her leery grunts and gruffs with anonymous people. There are some more stories too, but they end up as mostly peripheral tales in this compendium of short takes on love and longing in LA.<br>
<br>
The film doesn't quite live up to Garry Marshall's rendition of the Cinderella myth in Pretty Woman, but it fits in with the mood of the moment.<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Armored may have a run-of-the-mill storyline, yet, surprisingly, it manages to keep you glued to your seats. You don't even mind the fact that most of the drama takes place in the closed interiors of an abandoned warehouse with just a bunch of characters. And that's because there's a nervous energy that palpitates through the entire proceedings, as a bunch of desperate guys try to hold onto their basic decency, despite crossing over to crime.<br>
<br>
At the onset, while planning the million dollar heist, gang leader Matt Dillon tells his associates there's nothing to fear because nothing can go wrong. Why? Hey, we're good guys, he exclaims, drawing a fine line between themselves and hardcore criminals. But when does the line get blurred, nobody really knows. Ty, the reluctant robber, gets a sudden conscience call when the gang ends up killing an innocent man. Desperate to opt out, he takes refuge in the armored truck carrying the loot and sets into motion a counter attack that sees the gang crumbling, one by one.<br>
<br>
The high point of the film is the fact that it emphasises the importance of ethics, without getting all moralistic about it. Yes, good guys do finish first, but not before the guns have exploded and the fire has raged.<br>
<br>
Explosive, in fits and starts, Armored is a thriller with an edge.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> The film is a biopic which traces the rise of Coco Gabrielle Chanel from her beginnings as an ordinary seamstress who grew up in an orphanage to the alpha woman who pioneered a whole new style of fashion that dominated the 20th century and continues to hold sway, even today.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The film focuses primarily on the life of Coco Gabrielle Chanel before she set up the house of Chanel. It's only the last shot which sees her sitting and watching her empire unfold before her, as model after model sashays down the ramp, displaying high art after high art. Indeed, a memorable frame that lingers with you, long after curtain call....<br>
<br>
But, it isn't only the last frame that leaves an impact. Anne Fontaine's biopic is a sheer visual delight as it juxtaposes Coco's rebelliousness against a namby-pamby age of both French morals and couture. More importantly, it paints a compelling picture of a woman who not only revolutionised women's fashion but towered in a world solely dominated by men. No, Coco didn't only break the glass ceiling, she broke the entire fortress of glass with her egalitarian and utilitarian fashion line that rid women's fashion of its useless frills, baubles and plumes. Women don't need to feel like curtains, believed Coco, and went about cutting, trimming, tightening and throwing away the corset completely. All this, while she chose to live life on her own terms, choosing the man she wanted to live with (Benoit Poelvoorde) and the man she wanted to love (Alessandro Nivola).<br>

Watch the film for its character sketch, its authenticity and for a towering performance by Audrey Tautou in the eponymous role.

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> So why do marriages go on the rocks? And why do some marriages rock?

The trouble with Couples Retreat is there's too much talk and too little fun. Moreover, it's low on wit and humour, making the proceedings quite long drawn and unfunny.
