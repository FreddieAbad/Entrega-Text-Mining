"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Even monsters need a vacation! While enjoying some quality family time on a cruise away from his monster hotel, Dracula (voiced by Adam Sandler) falls in love with a human but there's more to her than meets the eye.<br><br><br><strong>Review:</strong> Sony Pictures Animation's Hotel Transylvania 3 is perhaps the franchise’s weakest instalment so far. Despite A list actors getting back together to voice the brand’s likeable monsters, the story is way too clichéd and predictable for your liking. While you wait to be transported to a world of love, laughter and tears, all you end up feeling is sleepy. With zero twists and turns in the plot, the third outing fails to hold your interest despite its relatively short runtime (1 hour, 37 minutes).<br><br><br>While animation films tend to cater to moviegoers across all age groups, you fear that this might not even appeal to its core target audience — the kids. Since Pixar studios have upped the ante for animation films over the years, Sony’s earnest but formulaic attempt looks grossly mediocre and outdated, in this day and age. <br><br><br>The story lacks the emotional connect or conflict; making the dialogue seem preachy, repetitive and eventually yawn-inducing. The fun moments barely last as they are often overshadowed by an over simplistic and hackneyed plot. Even the father-daughter track, which lies at the heart of this story, fails to salvage this forgettable saga about ‘monsters can be good people’. Hotel Transylvania 3 has its meagre share of heartfelt moments but overall, it’s not the adventurous vacation film you expect it to be. <br><br><br>Like its visibly jaded vampire protagonist, this franchise needs a vacation to figure out how and whether it should resurrect for the fourth time. Immortality could be worse than death after all. <br> <br>","2.5"
"<div class='Normal'><b>Skyscraper Story</b>: Former FBI Hostage Rescue Team leader and U.S. war veteran Will Sawyer, now assesses security for skyscrapers. On assignment in China, he’s trapped along with his family in the tallest building in the world as it is suddenly set ablaze. It’s now up to him to survive and rescue them.<br><br><b>Skyscraper Review</b>: Dwayne Johnson is at the point in his career where he can confidently feature in derivative films with the knowledge that they'll coast along merely on his charisma. 'Skyscraper' certainly doesn't try to be new or innovative in any way. It's the same setup we've seen before in 'Towering Inferno' and 'Die Hard' where people are trapped in buildings and need to be rescued against all odds. That's pretty much what we have here as well. Throw in some 'Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol' stunts and that summarises this film in a nutshell. <br><br>But fortunately, the makers are aware of this, so they go ahead and embrace it. Writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber has worked with Dwayne Johnson before so he knows precisely how to utilise his acting skills. Johnson's Will Sawyer isn't too complicated - he is a trained soldier who has been relegated to a security job after a failed mission costs him his leg. However, he needs to tap into his military training when his family is put at risk when they get trapped in the world's tallest building in Hong Kong. All Sawyer cares about is saving his wife and kids, while taking on the bad guys. Even the villains are your standard East-European mercenaries whose primary motive is money. They aren't exactly threatening and are far from memorable. <br><br>Despite all these negative aspects, the movie falls smack down the middle of 'you get what you paid for' territory. This allows you to push logic out of the building (pun intended) and savour the mayhem as it unfolds. Johnson and Neve Campbell, as Sawyer's wife Sarah, have ample experience to keep their performances rooted enough without being campy. That said, this one might be worth your money and time only if your expectations aren't sky-high and you enjoy predicting what happens next in movies<br><br>","3.0"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Hotel Artemis Story: </strong>Set in a dystopian, riot-torn Los Angeles, the film follows a nurse (Jodie Foster) who runs a secret, members-only emergency room for the criminals. The existing tension escalates when the most dangerous crime lord (Jeff Goldblum as the Wolf King) shows up at the hotel, wounded. <br><br><strong>Hotel Artemis Review: </strong>Dark, brooding and eerie — Hotel Artemis is a suspenseful and atmospheric crime thriller that works on your mind but fails to build upon the tension created. Boasting of some compelling performances led by Foster, the film manages to up your intrigue but struggles to maintain it. Set within the four walls of the hotel and revolving around a handful of notorious characters with mysterious motives, the narrative tempts us to discover their backstories. However, this road to discovery and redemption is way too sluggish and stretched to be engaging. The ambiguity becomes exhausting beyond a point, leading to boredom. <br><br>A film of this nature deserved slicker action scenes as well, which is grossly missed. Drew Pearce’s ambition to infuse human emotions in this unsettling, and partially gory, crime thriller doesn’t really work. What you eventually get is a random mishmash of psychological horror and futuristic humane drama. Jodie Foster is brilliant as always. <br><br>Overall, the film struggles with pace but one can still watch it for the unusual treatment and character portrayal. Only if the director could take it all further to a logical conclusion instead of targeting his movie for a niche, select film festival audience. <br><br>","3.0"

The three must dig into the past to unravel secrets that attract the unsolicited attention of their unusual nemesis. <br><br><strong>Ant Man And The Wasp Review:</strong> MCU! Just how do they do it? Despite hordes of Marvel films being unleashed on the audience at regular intervals, superhero exhaustion is nowhere in sight. Set after 'Captain America: Civil War' and leading up to the events of ''Avengers: Infinity War','the Ant-man sequel is a thrilling fun ride that engages you emotionally and amuses you with its CGI antics and comic demeanour. <br><br>The sequel sees Scott Lang smartly juggling between his fatherhood duties, tackling the FBI and a new superhero mission. Though the shrinking ability of the protagonists is the film’s USP, what lies at the heart of this film is the father-son bond between Casey-Scott and Hank-Hope. <br><br>Peyton Reed lets human relationships drive the narrative. Not once does he allow the ‘juicy tech stuff’ to own his film, which is refreshing and perhaps the reason why Marvel films command such a massive fan base across the globe. <br><br>Michael Pena’s superb presence and rapid-fire monologue coupled with a rant on truth serum turns out to be the film’s funniest scene. However, what does feel underwhelming are the ‘villains’ or the lack of real ones per se. <br><br>Overall, 'Ant-Man' and the Wasp is the Marvel underdog that scores big, replicating the nature of the ongoing Football World Cup. It also explains why Lang didn’t join the Avengers in Infinity War. Watch it!<br><br>PS: Do wait for the mid and post credits scenes! <br>","4.0"

The film is riddled with mean moments and sequences where friends stoop down to low levels of integrity and morality. They’ll do anything to avoid being the ‘it’ player of the gang and that is in stark contrast to what the original story is all about.<br><br>Debut director Jeff Tomsic’s attempt is honest but the execution is not.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong><br>A sequel of Sicario (2015), this film picks up the same theme of Mexican drug cartels and their involvement in illegal cross border activities between the US and Mexico. This time, CIA operative Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) teams up with Alejandro Gillick (Benicio del Toro) to crack down on the cartels trafficking people across the border and allowing terrorists to enter Texas. <br><br><strong>Review:</strong><br>As sequels go, Sicario: Day Of The Soldado tries to up the scale and action from its predecessor. Where director Denis Villeneuve’s 2015 thriller managed to strike a fine balance between grit and drama, Stefano Sollima’s sequel stays focussed on action alone. A key character from the first film, Kate Mercer (Emily Blunt) isn’t a part of the story this time and that makes all the difference. The narrative misses her pathos and her constant sense of fear. While Sicario 2 is an engaging film with great action sequences, the stunning visual appeal doesn’t quite make up for the absence of a genuine emotional core. This one has all the thrills but very little heart.<br><br>The story is based entirely around the US-Mexico border. The setting keeps shifting between Texas and Mexico City, but for the most part, the film plays out in the desert between the two countries. It’s a dusty landscape that’s reminiscent of the Westerns and that sets the mood for Sicario 2. The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski and the background score by Hildur Guðnadóttir make this movie a lot better than it actually is. Both the cinematographer and the composer work on the same template that made the original movie so artistically wonderful. While Sicario 2 has its technical strengths, the writing is a bit wish-wash. The lead characters, Graver and Alejandro wage a war against the drug cartels and the Mexican police, but their actions are a bit too convenient and there are no consequences at all. They kidnap the daughter of a Mexican drug lord and there’s no backlash from his gang. The writers really seemed to have missed the bus with Sicario 2.<br><br>Nevertheless, the performances by Josh Brolin and Benicio del Toro are top notch. Brolin plays the clay-cold Graver with ease, while del Toro builds on the legend of his character and his ability to be Mexico’s version of Léon: The Professional. While he’s not dodging bullets, he can pull off the most outrageous feats with ease. If you enjoy the thrill of gun fights and larger-than-life characters, Sicario 2 can be an engaging experience. Just don’t expect it to make too much sense.<br>","3.0"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Set in a dystopian future, the mayor of the fictional Japanese city Megasaki, banishes all the dogs in the region to an abandoned island after a canine-flu virus infects them.<br><br><strong>Review: </strong>If you’ve watched any of Wes Anderson’s films, you know you’re in for a unique experience. Anderson’s love for vivid colours and symmetry is now a case-study in film cinematography. But in ‘Isle of Dogs’, it’s easy to see that he takes his idiosyncrasies a notch higher in what is his second stop-motion film. Every single frame has been painstakingly crafted. When combined with Anderson’s perfectly balanced compositions and bright colour palate, the result is genuinely magical.<br><br>‘Isle of Dogs’ sounds like ‘I Love Dogs’, and it’s easy to see why dog-lovers are in for a treat. But irrespective of your canine preferences, this is an endearing story. The central focus is on a pack trying to survive on meagre scraps and rubbish they can find. This changes when Atari – the mayor’s nephew, sneaks on to the island to find his dog Spots. The pack is voiced by Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Bob Balaban, Bill Murray & Jeff Goldblum, and it’s hard not to fall in love with them individually, and as a group. The entire talented ensemble is perfectly cast, and the dialogue is tailor-made for each actor, and who we think they are in real-life. Although there are multiple angles to it, the story serves as an analogy for our love of animals, while also possibly reflecting how immigrants are treated as outsiders within their country of residence. Both of which are timely, and relevant. There’s also an abundance of Japan’s vibrant culture and the perfect mix of their heritage along with Anderson’s futuristic vision.<br><br>However, the biggest grievance with this film is the lack of subtitles for the Japanese dialogues. Granted there are translations worked into the narrative so it doesn’t feel forced, but this leads to some disconnect with the Japanese characters. It’s an odd decision not to include those subtitles, as that takes you out of the film’s experience during those exchanges. Still, Anderson ensures that you’re connected to all the charming characters when you aren’t being dazzled by the film’s sheer gorgeousness. Especially at a time when CGI-heavy visual effects bombard us, it’s indeed heartening to experience an old-school animation film like this. It’s one of the movies that should be experienced on the big screen to truly appreciate all the intricate details that have gone into creating it step-by-step. But it’s also a movie that you’d want to own just to admire its beauty as every screenshot is a work of art worth hanging on your wall.<br>","4"

After Ellen passes away, Anne’s daughter Charlie starts acting strange. Later, she meets with a terrible accident and her brother Peter blames himself for it. As he is dealing with guilt, Annie is urged to conduct a séance to help her move on with the losses she has suffered. The exercise goes wrong and the entire Graham family have to face a mysterious evil force that is unstoppable and something that will not leave them alone.<br><br>Horror films have a habit of following a formula and recycling it until another film comes and charts a new course. Haunted homes, demonic possessions and other similar tropes have littered the landscape of the genre since a while. That way, Ari Aster’s directorial debut 'Hereditary' is truly an original that moves slowly yet completely and totally terrifies you when you least expect it to. A stylistically brilliant film, 'Hereditary' cleverly makes you suspect that it could just be a psychological thriller and not an out-and-out horror, until the supernatural takes hold and completely scares you. Aside from the supernatural elements, the film is a vividly-crafted story of relationships between parents and their kids.<br><br>Ari effectively creates an eerie atmosphere that is further accentuated by a blood-curdling soundtrack by Colin Stetson. Pawel Pogorzelski creates a creepy atmosphere with his cinematography and amplifies the scare-factor by focusing on the cold weather. Toni Collete as Anne has a perfect character graph and delivers a masterful performance along with other cast members including Alex Wolff, Milly Shapiro and Gabriel Byrne. Ann Dowd has a wonderful role and plays it to perfection. The filmmaker is spot on with his casting in this one. <br><br>If you are looking to truly and completely get scared, 'Hereditary' will ensure that happens in the best and most unexpected way possible.<br><br>","4"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Ocean's 8 Story: </strong>Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock) is released from prison and she immediately starts working on a plan to steal Cartier diamonds from the Met Gala. She seeks the help of her best friend Lou (Cate Blanchett) and they assemble an all-women crew to execute the high-stake heist. <br><br><strong>Ocean's 8 Review: </strong>‘Ocean’s 8’ drops all the men in favour of a scintillating cast of women. The new all-women setup puts a fresh perspective on this heist franchise. As you’d expect from an ‘Ocean’s’ movie, this film has some great set pieces on planning the robbery. Because the film’s central characters are all women, their conversations mix the usual hustle talk with fashion, shopping and style related subjects and that makes things interesting. While they do talk about men too, thankfully it doesn’t go over-the-top with the bashing or swooning. The girls stay focussed on their task at hand, to pull off the heist in the smartest of fashion. The film has the same busy and slick feel of Steven Soderbergh’s movies with George Clooney; it’s just as funny and engaging too. But it’s not as smart or detailed as those films. In an attempt to pull off the twists, the film takes a few cinematic liberties. <br><br>Sandra Bullock takes over the ‘Ocean’ mantle from George Clooney. She’s introduced as his sister and he’s pretty much dead. Nonetheless, she talks her way out of prison and the moment she steps out, she starts recruiting a crew to pull off a heist that would make her infamous brother proud. Cate Blanchett steps into the shoes of the best friend and fixer, a role that was Brad Pitt’s domain in the past. A lot of the previous film’s characters make surprise cameos in the movie too. But for all its references to the franchise, ‘Ocean’s 8’ also brings a lot of new things to the table. The new characters bring new quirks. Helena Bonham Carter plays a down-on-luck fashion designer Rose Weil, Rihanna is the hacker with the weird name Nine Ball, Mindy Kaling is the Indian girl who’s an expert on diamonds and jewellery, Sarah Paulson is Tammy who’s an expert on logistics and finally there’s Awkwafina, the Asian girl with the sleight of hand. There’s also Anne Hathaway, who plays a Hollywood actress and the ladies piggy back on her celebrity status into the Met Gala in New York. <br><br>‘Ocean’s 8’ is just as audacious as it is clever. The first half of the film especially sets up a strong story. The way Sandra Bullock’s Debbie swindles and shop lifts with confidence is fantastic. Blanchett’s character’s people skills and constant sense of sarcasm and cynicism is entertaining too. Once the other girls join in, the team shows some great chemistry and there’s a lot witty dialogue on offer. The second half loses a little steam, especially during the climactic portions when all the heist details are revealed. The script doesn’t quite incorporate the same detail and finesse in explaining the robbery as it does in setting things up. <br><br>But a spectacular performance by Sandra Bullock overshadows the minor flaws in the plan. Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway are pitch-perfect with their comedic flair too. A brief appearance by James Corden right at the end shakes things up nicely too. Director Gary Ross, presents a well-cut heist movie. There’s a constant reference to Clooney’s Danny Ocean in the film which also keeps the spark alive. ‘Ocean’s 8’ may not be as sharp as the films that featured Clooney and his gang pull off world class thefts with élan, but this movie has a lot of style and substance to please even the hard core genre fans.<br>","3.5"

After their home was destroyed, the Parr family is given a new lease of life when they’re approached by wealthy siblings Winston (Bob Odenkirk) and Evelyn Deavor (Catherine Keener). Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) is tasked with being the new face of superheroes in the hopes of restoring their legal status. To support her, Mr Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) takes on the responsibility of looking after the kids at home, which proves to be quite the handful. To make matters worse, the mind-controlling villain Screenslaver threatens the city.<br><br>When you consider the rapid-fire rate of superhero movies in today’s comic book franchise-driven landscape, it’s a surprise that this sequel took 14 years to make. Picking up right after the events of its prequel – the film wastes little time getting back into its quick-paced groove. Even though an entire generation has grown up exploring various aspects of superhero storytelling, ‘Incredibles 2’ manages to have a relatively fresh and unique perspective. Elastigirl and Mr Incredible are duty-bound to reverse the roles they typically play within the family, resulting in hilarious, yet thought-provoking situations. Additionally, the motivations of the ‘bad guy’ go far beyond being a generic villain with dreams of world domination.<br><br>This drives the film into engaging narrative territories that would undoubtedly appeal to older audiences. But there’s slapstick and eye-candy for younger kids to enjoy, peppered with ample comedy for all ages. All the voice acting is strong, but the MVP turns out to be the one with the least amount of dialogue – Jack-Jack, who absolutely steals the show. The fact that visual effects have developed so much over the past fourteen years only adds to the immersive experience, as each character and eye-popping action is brought to life in stunning animation. Writer & director Brad Bird believed in waiting for the right story to tell, and that decision certainly pays off in more ways than one as ‘Incredibles 2’ proves to be an Incredible amount of fun!<br><br>","4.0"
"<div class='Normal'><b>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom Story</b>: Three years after the events of ‘Jurassic World’, Owen (Chris Pratt) & Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) lead a deadly mission to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from extinction.<br><br><b>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom Review</b>: Visual effects have indeed come a long way since Steven Spielberg’s ‘Jurassic Park’ in 1993. The CGI-heavy series received a fresh shot in the arm with 2015’s ‘Jurassic World’, bringing new talent, and new dinosaurs into the mix. ‘Fallen Kingdom’ tries a different take by changing things up a bit for the series. A dormant volcano on the abandoned island of Isla Nublar threatens to bury the revived dinosaurs. This catastrophic natural disaster compels Owen & Claire to team up once more as they try to save these magnificent creatures.<br><br>Without revealing much else, this premise takes the majority of the action out its usual element, and for the most part, the film is better off for it. Director J. A. Bayona utilises these new rules to infuse some much-needed terror. What’s somewhat lacking, however, is the emotional connection to the story as a whole. Sure, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are both great performers and familiarity with their characters allow a semblance of emotional investment. But it’s too few and far between set-pieces that tend to get tedious after a while, affecting the pacing along the way. It also doesn’t help that the new characters bring little to the story and some old ones, such as Jeff Goldblum’s highly anticipated return as Ian Malcolm, are a significant letdown.<br><br>Hidden in the midst of it all is an intriguing debate on whether it’s worth saving a species once extinct, now capable of returning the world to ancient times. A poignant moment where a Brachiosaurus is destroyed, further begs the question of this dilemma. Sadly, this whole angle is barely explored, although one suspects it might become the focal point of the next entry in the series. Keeping that aside, there’s a lot to savour in the devastation of expendable scenery, and extras. ‘Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom’ excels when it allows the real stars – the CGI dinosaurs – to shine, and roar louder than most of their predecessors.<br>","3.5"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Based on a book by Jonathan Ames, Lynne Ramsay's neo noir film explores the psyche of a troubled war veteran turned contract killer Joe (Joaquin Phoenix), who makes a living by rescuing underage girls from sex trafficking. During one such rescue missions, he is forced to face and resurrect his buried emotions when he uncovers a deadly conspiracy.<br><br><br><strong>Review:</strong> Lynne Ramsay, known for telling sombre stories on aftermath of a troubled past without resorting to much dialogue, does it once again. She straps you to the edge of your seat throughout the course of this intense, spine-chilling thriller that is strangely reminiscent of John Krasinski’s ‘A Quiet Place’.<br><br><br>Like Krasinski’s survival horror, Ramsay’s psychological mystery leaves you transfixed by fear and suffocated. Both films exude this rare ability of turning their viewers into the protagonists, thus making you live the horror instead of merely watching it from a distance. You dread to make a single noise, let alone breathe freely at the fear of being the next casualty. <br><br><br>What makes this Cannes favourite vastly distinct is its ability to showcase the protagonist’s contradicting emotional and moral arc. Joe is brutally violent, makes living out of killing people but won’t trade his conscience for anything. You feel for him and his scarred, abusive childhood despite the barbaric ways he chooses to carry on. Atmospheric and terrifying, you watch Joe’s every move like a hawk. There’s not a single dull moment as Ramsay keeps building the tension throughout with an odd mix of consistent eerie silence, throbbing sound effects and disturbing flashbacks. You get lured into unravelling Joe’s traumatic past by wanting to piece the puzzle together.<br><br><br>While the film is supremely engaging, it is Joaquin Phoenix, who breathes life and intrigue into its cold existence. One of the greatest actors of today, only a Phoenix can play both — a caring son who looks after his old mother and a hired gun that nonchalantly beats people to death with a hammer.<br><br><br>You Were Never Really Here is taut, gritty, weird and unsettling. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea but if you fancy such psychological thrillers, this one’s a must watch, especially for the raw brilliance of Joaquin Phoenix. <br>","4"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Book Club Story: </strong>Four best friends, Diane (Diane Keaton), Vivian (Jane Fonda), Carol (Mary Steenburgen) and Sharon (Candice Bergen) meet every month for a book club. The senior citizen ladies stumble upon the novel 50 Shades Of Grey and after reading the high-on-sex content, each one experiences a life-changing event. <br><br><strong>Book Club Review: </strong>'Book Club' is a certified romcom with an old-school twist. The protagonists in this multi-track movie aren't high school girls or young divas; they’re all 60-plus women. They try to rekindle romance into their lives, inspired by the risqué ideas in EL James’ novel, '50 Shades Of Grey'. Their book club meetings turn into conversations about kinky and passionate sex. It's fun to watch these seasoned women behave like teens while employing some hilarious double-meaning dialogues. <br><br>Diane is a widow and a mother who's coping with her control-freak daughters after the recent loss of her husband. Vivian is an hotelier with commitment issues, Sharon is a federal judge who's separated from her husband and Carol is a chef who’s going through a sexless period in her 35-year marriage. The characters are all typical middle-aged women who haven't experienced the kind of sexual pleasures that are described in Christian Grey's adventures. The fact that these women are portrayed by Hollywood greats like Jane Fonda, Diane Keaton and Candice Bergen makes things very interesting. Mary Steenburgen is a celebrated actress too. And once they start behaving like excited teenagers, the film becomes quite entertaining. <br><br>Not just the ladies, the film also has yesteryear actors like Don Johnson and Andy Garcia. There’s even a super cameo by Richard Dreyfuss. And yet, 'Book Club' isn’t just a nostalgic trip with familiar stars, it’s a fun film where oldies have as much fun, if not more, than millennials. <br><br>The only minor grouse with this romantic comedy is the fact that it doesn’t bring in the gravitas and depth that you’d want to see with such a fantastic line-up of acting legends. The film stays flaky and frivolous. Thankfully, it’s very entertaining and the sight of an 80-year-old Jane Fonda, looking like a million bucks throughout, is just a testament to the fact that somethings never get old. Ditto for romantic comedies.<br>","3.5"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> A young Han Solo meets his co-pilot Chewbacca & Lando Calrissian years before the events of ‘Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope’<br><br><strong>Review: </strong>Origin stories are tricky enough as they come, but the challenge of making a film on a beloved anti-hero in one of the most revered movie franchises is a whole different task altogether. Add to the fact that ‘Solo: A Star Wars Story’ went through a lot of production woes, and even a die-hard fan would be right to ask – is the Force strong with this one? It’s crucial to ponder on these issues behind-the-scenes because they become glaringly apparent in the film’s pacing and tonality – the first casualties of an underwhelming storyline.<br><br>‘Solo’ jumps from one action setpiece to the next, with minimal character development. Sure, there are moments that spark some soul into the film, such as Han meeting Chewbacca for the first time, along with the very first glimpse of the fabled Millenium Falcon. But beyond obvious nostalgia-inducing bits, there is little else to cherish. This isn’t the fault of the cast, and yet, not much depth is added to the parts they play. Alden Ehrenreich is perfectly fine as Han Solo. It’s near impossible to replace the enigmatic Harrison Ford, but Ehrenreich does his own nuanced take on the lovable rogue. As does Donald Glover in his rendition of the charismatic Lando Calrissian. The characters played by Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton and Paul Bettany aren’t too memorable, but they serve their purpose within the story. Emilia Clarke’s Qi’ra is arguably the most intriguing addition from this film to this folklore as she keeps you guessing about her motivations.<br><br>Admittedly, the last act makes up for its plodding initial 2/3rds with some potentially exciting developments. In the end, director Ron Howard manages to salvage the remnants of the production mess to a fair extent. While he plays it safe and loses some of the mythical Star Wars allure along the way, he succeeds in creating a decent sci-fi action film. ‘Solo: A Star Wars Story’ has enough action, CGI spectacle, and callbacks to satisfy both its old and new fans while barely justifying its addition to the franchise.<br><br>","3.5"

Credit goes to the writers for ensuring that the constant wisecracks, digs at other superheroes or pop culture references, don’t distract a viewer from the story’s emotional core and it’s protagonist’s moral ambiguity.</p><p>While the action is brilliantly shot and executed, the comedy smartly doubles up as a social commentary on racism, sexism, body shaming and sexual harassment.</p><p>Boasting of some great unsuspecting cameos, the story humanises Deadpool, without letting go of what makes him different — deviant ways, indulgence in gory violence, sarcasm and narcissism.

Good business sense demanded a sequel – so here we are. Once again, Wuba is being chased down by monsters and humans alike. His human parents, played by Baihe Bai & Boran Jing are also in search of him, and they encounter some odd characters along the way, leading to potentially comedic scenarios. In this second outing, director Raman Hui has adopted a breakneck pace of storytelling, constantly putting the protagonists into precarious situations. While this works in theory, it’s a whole different ballgame in execution, as Raman and the rest of the cast keep throwing sequence after sequence in quick succession, with minimal plot and character development.</p><p>In fact, besides Wuba and his human parents, a lot of time is spent with Tony Leung Chiu-wai’s character Tu Sigu – an understandable choice going by Tony’s popularity in China. But these scenes are stretched out to a drag, serving little purpose other than cheaps laughs. The movie goes through a whole bunch of shenanigans in the same way. Worsened by choppy editing, it jumps from one set piece to the next with minimal storytelling along the way. This is a pity because ‘Monster Hunt 2’ is visually gorgeous, with scenic natural landscapes, stunning set design and colourful costumes. But as far as the story goes, there’s nothing memorable.</p><p>If you’re not familiar with ‘Monster Hunt’ – Wuba – the radish-like monster baby with four hands is undoubtedly the reason for the first film’s success. This sequel constantly hints at a far more significant story about this baby’s heritage. There is recurrent talk about humans and monsters being able to co-exist with each other, and Wuba playing a role in that, but we never get to see any of it. We’re left with a colourful, yet mostly bland kid’s film that might have you chuckling now and then, but is quite underwhelming.</p><p></p>","2.5"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>10 years in the making, the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) comes together to take on the mighty Thanos who threatens to put an end to the universe.<br><br><strong>Review: </strong>Irrespective of your opinion on the superhero film genre, you cannot deny that ‘Avengers: Infinity War’ is an ambitious undertaking – the biggest of its kind, making it a significant event in film history. Marvel Studios took a decade to meticulously plan this mammoth showdown of all their fictional heroes together for the first time on screen. To say that the MCU has a lot riding on this would be a gross understatement, evident by their massive marketing campaign visible everywhere. But the billion-dollar question is – does it live up to the hype.<br><br>Quick answer? Oh yes, it does! All the superheroes get their moments to shine, and while some naturally take predominance over the others, no role feels minor at any point. Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely’s efforts need special mention for putting together the most crucial and challenging element in a film of this magnitude – the screenplay. From the film’s opening moments, their goal to create a clear and coherent narrative is evident. The Russo Brothers take this material and enhance it to bring out some fantastic performances, along with the large-scale action one has come to expect from the MCU. Keeping this balance is not only tricky but also essential to maintain audience interest over a period of two and a half hours. There’s barely a dull scene; in fact, MCU’s trademark humour is intact and paired with several gut-wrenching moments that will be hard to forget once the credits roll.<br><br>The consequences of this entry on the MCU are tremendous, all due to the actions of the one single antagonist they have been building since ‘The Avengers’ in 2012. Josh Brolin had a high bar to meet, and his Thanos smashes all expectations with conviction. He is multi-dimensional with a looming presence to justify all his screen time. Facing him are the superheroes who will take you by surprise on multiple occasions. It’s a big team effort with every actor swinging for the fences. The only drawback? All the blistering action, relentless humor and plot intersections might get overwhelming to the casual viewer. But it’s all part of the plan – there’s so much to digest it warrants a second viewing. If you’ve felt we’re nearing superhero exhaustion, Marvel just went and changed the rules leaving you begging for more – proving yet again that they are the real masters of this game.<br>","4.5"
"<div class='Normal'><b>STORY:</b> A group of six friends go on a vacation to Mexico when a stranger tricks them into playing the game of truth or dare with him, which leads to a series of paranormal incidents in their lives.<br><br> <b>REVIEW:</b> When spring break starts, Markie Cameron (Violett Beane) cajoles her best friend Olivia Barron (Lucy Hale) into joining their gang in Mexico for a two-week vacation. On their last night, the already inebriated bunch of kids looks for more alcohol when a random stranger at the bar-Carter (Landon Liboiron) offers to take them to an abandoned missionary, in a secluded area, with the promise of providing them with unlimited booze. Once in, Carter suggests they play the game of truth or dare and that’s exactly when the paranormal and at times fatal incidents start taking place.<br><br> ‘Truth or Dare’ is one of those horror-thriller flicks you wish weren’t made in the first place. The fright element in this Jeff Wadlow-helmed movie is laughable and so passé. Characters come in and out of demonic possession randomly and everything about the paranormal elements is far away from evoking terror—the ghostly sounds are a constant reminder of the ludicrous 90s horror films, the actors have acted badly, the writing is predictable and dragged beyond imagination. The background score only makes the movie feel even more juvenile and insipid.<br><br> All in all, ‘Truth or Dare’ is recommended to those who love to have a good laugh while watching horror flicks. If you expect some nail-biting and scream-filled moments from your horror flick, then you will be mighty disappointed. This game of truth or dare is better left unplayed.<br>","1.5"
"<div class='Normal'><hr><p>Story: Based on a popular arcade game from the ’80s, Rampage is about three giant creatures wreaking havoc on human cities. Davis (Dwayne Johnson) is a primatologist and handler of one of the creatures, George the gorilla. While the creatures destroy everything in their path, Davis teams up with Dr Chadwell (Naomie Harris) and Agent Russel (Jeffery Dean Morgan) to stop them.</p><p>Review: Rampage, as the name would suggest, is a movie about giant creatures tearing up the civilized world. As you’d expect from this genre faithful, there’s an abundance of loud and gory violence, as a giant albino gorilla, a Godzilla-like crocodile and a mammoth wolf run rampant in the human world. Their only foil, is a hulk-sized Dwayne Johnson playing a hybrid of characters he’s played before in movies like Journey 2 The Mysterious Island, San Andreas, Jumanji and Welcome To The Jungle / The Rundown. Like most creature features, Rampage is a film with a simple premise. The giant mutated creatures will break and smash everything in sight, while the muscular hero and his band of eclectic individuals will try to save the day.</p><p>The original smash ‘em up game was about breaking and climbing buildings. The movie scales up those seemingly simple actions with a sci-fi upgrade. Here, a science experiment on advance genetics, being conducted aboard a space station, goes horribly wrong, in a Ridley Scott’s Alien sort of way. The mutagen crash lands on Earth and it turns an average wolf, crocodile and an exotic looking gorilla into giant scary monsters. The company behind the experiments is headed by the greedy sister-brother duo Claire (Malin Akerman) and Brett Wyden (Jake Lacy) who only care about making profits from the biological armageddon at hand. In the ensuing mayhem of the creatures running around Chicago, the US army joins Davis and his friends to both record and stop the doom.</p><p>The action in Rampage has been captured to great effect. The sights of blowing up cars and breaking skyscrapers doesn’t look dizzying as it did in films like The Avengers or Man Of Steel. While this is no superhero film, the crash and burn action sequences certainly give the effect of one. Dwayne Johnson squares off against these monsters like he’s a superhero. Thankfully there are no OTT sequences featuring him killing the creatures. But his onscreen charisma is big enough to keep you hooked on to the film. The biggest flaw of Rampage though is its predictability. Every set piece in this movie has been done-to-death in movies like King Kong, Godzilla and Johnson’s own San Andreas. Jeffery Dean Morgan as the cowboy super agent though is a big put off. Same goes for Naomie Harris who plays the clever scientist like a damsel in distress.</p><p>Despite the pastiche form, director Brad Peyton still manages to make this mindless-action fiesta a fun ride. His film isn’t the smartest movie ever made, but it does serve up some cool fan boys moments. The camaraderie between the gorilla and Dwayne Johnson is cool brings in an element of humour to this otherwise generic end-of-the-world movie. This one’s definitely worth a one-time watch.</p>","3.5"
"<div class='Normal'><p><strong>Story:</strong></p><p>A young American scientist travels to India to sell a genetically modified rice strain to help Indian farmers but she doesn’t know that the same grain will end up ruining the same people she plans to help.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong></p><p>When the trailer of ‘Basmati Blues’ was released, there was a lot of hue and cry about how the movie suffered from the white saviour complex and that on some level it was racially insensitive; something not all that unfounded when one watches the film. But there is a lot more to the film.</p><p>The basic concept of the film, that American seed companies have been waging an overt and covert war to get their GMO seeds into Indian farmlands is not fiction; is true. That is the main point the filmmakers seem to be making here. While their heart seems to be in the right place, their limited knowledge about the country and the filter that the west views India with, seems to have resulted into several cringe-worthy moments. While the music in the film is quite entertaining, the way that the songs are picturised is more bizarre than trippy. There are funny moments in the film, chiefly those between Rajit (Utkarsh Ambudkar) and Linda. Lakshmi Manchu as Rajit’s sister and Bugs Bhargava Krishna as his father have small yet fun roles to play. Donald Sutherland as the baddie is a joy to watch and he brings a sort of Dr Evil like comic intensity to his role as the CEO of the evil seed company.</p><p>Better as a political comedy than as a musical, this Basmati dish will leave you longing for something a tad spicy.</p>","2"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story</strong>: 17-year-old Katie (Bella Thorne) has a rare genetic illness that makes her hyper sensitive to sunlight. Forbidden from stepping out at daytime, fate makes her run into her childhood crush Charlie (Patrick Schwarzenegger) at night. The two fall in love in the moonlight, swim in the ocean and kiss under the stars, knowing there won’t be an ever after.<br><br><strong>Review</strong>: Be it ‘A walk to Remember’, ‘Me Before You’, ‘The Fault in our stars’ and the most recent ‘Everything, Everything’. Several romantic dramas in the past with similar themes, better performances and superior execution, have managed to tug at our heartstrings. These movies ably captured the beauty and thrill of an unlikely romance, and it becoming the ray of hope in the lives of the protagonists who had given up on their dreams. The writing and screen adaptations in most cases, made you anticipate miracles, hoping eternal happiness for the couples struggling to survive. They worked effortlessly because of its unique treatment to an otherwise done to death plot.<br><br>Sadly, the sun never really shines on Midnight Sun. It is an unimaginative copy of all the popular films in the genre with not one unique quality to it. The only takeaway from this film is a disease — Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and that’s not what you expect from it.<br><br>Despite a likeable lead pair, the writing is so jaded, cliched and shallow that you don’t feel for the couple, their love or their loss. In its under two hours runtime, the mushy story and character development are so hastily handled that nothing looks convincing. Especially the ‘love at first sight’, feels orchestrated, convenient and downright predictable.<br><br>Bella Thorne is a pleasant actor and singer. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s son Patrick, who is a chocolate boy version of his famous dad, relatively has more facial expressions than his father but fails to engage you emotionally with his performance.<br><br>If cliched romantic tearjerkers interest you, you can give this half-hearted exercise a shot. But if you wish to watch a timeless romance, turn to ‘Call me by your name’. As they say, there are too many mediocre things in life and love (or love stories) shouldn’t be one of them.<br><br>","2.5"
"<div class='Normal'><p><strong>A Quiet Place Story: </strong>A family lives in silence to survive blind creatures that hunt by sound.</p><p><strong>A Quiet Place Review: </strong>As genres go, horror is particularly challenging to crack. It’s easy to resort to cheap scares to get audiences jumping out of their seats. On the other hand, it takes an evolved set of storytelling skills to make them genuinely uncomfortable and fearful for the events unfolding onscreen. Actor, co-writer and director John Krasinski seems to understand this thoroughly, and the result is an unnerving film. The premise is intriguing – in the near future, humans are viciously hunted down by mysterious creatures equipped with a heightened sense of sound. Their only known weakness is that they are blind.</p><p>Krasinski uses this to create a dreadful sense of atmosphere throughout the film. The rules that exist in this universe are established early on with minimal exposition. After all, the characters can’t communicate with each other openly. Additionally, since very little is known about these creatures, the film smartly implements one of the fundamental rules of the genre – the fear of the unknown. This setup pushes the family to invent creative ways to survive. The cast is minimal – besides Krasinski, Emily Blunt plays his wife, and their real-life chemistry translates brilliantly. Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds play two of their children. Being a deaf actress, Millicent is the perfect choice to star in this mostly silent film, and her authentic performance stands out along with Blunt who showcases her impressive acting range. Horror, in particular, only works if you’re invested in the characters, and this cast absorbs you into their terrifying world.</p><p>As the conversations are primarily restricted to sign language, sound design plays a significant role in creating a heightened sense of dread and tension throughout. Although slow paced initially, this is a deliberate screenplay decision which then leads up to a suspenseful second half. Granted, some of the events require a brief suspension of reality, but it’s a small price to pay for a film that is most enjoyable because of its understanding of the genre and innovative use of the elements it sets up. A word of advice – choose your viewing partner carefully as ‘A Quiet Place’ can only be appreciated in silence with the least amount of conversation during its runtime. Better still – watch this alone (and switch off your phones), then loudly proceed to rave about this essential horror film to everyone else!</p>","4.0"
"<div class='Normal'>Story: An adaptation of Beatrix Potter’s classic story, 'The Tale of Peter Rabbit', this film follows the antics of a naughty rabbit hoping to lay siege on an old farmer’s vegetable garden.<br><br>Review: This live-action/animated film is an ode to the generations of readers who have grown up reading Potter’s simple tale about the antics of a mischievous rabbit. Peter Rabbit (voiceover James Corden) along with his triplet sisters — Flopsy (voiceover Margot Robbie), Mopsy (voiceover Elizabeth Debicki), Cotton-Tail (voiceover Daisy Ridley) and cousin Benjamin Bunny (voiceover Colin Moody) are a happy quintet, who are perpetually on a mission to raid old McGregor’s (Sam Neill) tempting vegetable patch. His neighbour, Bea (Rose Byrne) is a painter, who dotes on the rabbits and keeps a watchful eye on them. When a tragedy brings McGregor’s great-nephew Thomas (Domhnall Gleeson) to the house, he has no idea what he is up against. As the rabbits try their darnest best to send him packing, Thomas gives them a tough fight unknown to the kind-hearted Bea who finds herself falling for him.<br><br>While the animation is limited, Peter and his woodland friends are cute, and the quaint English countryside has been captured fairly well. Actor-comedian James Corden, giving the voiceover of Peter Rabbit, doesn’t quite live up to expectations — it often comes across like his character is trying too hard to reclaim what he believes is rightfully his. And it is this overenthusiasm that doesn’t always connect with the audience. <br><br>There are several funny moments though — for instance the face off between Peter and Thomas evokes laughter as you find yourself torn between rooting for the rambunctious rabbit and the exasperated landowner. The supporting characters are fun — Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-Tail and Benjamin often walk away with the cutest lines in the movie. Thomas and Bea as the couple falling in love may not showcase a lot of chemistry but are passable. Director Will Gluck does a decent job and the script, although not robust, will keep children — the primary target audience for this film — engaged and entertained. The film will find few adult takers but with vacations on in full swing, this is an ideal summer watch for kids. <br>","3"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story</strong>: The Jigsaw killer is back from the dead to play twisted death-games with his victims and judge whether they deserve to live or not.<br><br><strong>Review</strong>: 'Jigsaw' is the eighth movie in the slasher franchise, 'Saw'. If you’re seen any of the previous films, this time you may wonder about what that new rabbit would be that the filmmakers decide to pull out of the hat to make the film interesting. While the premise is the same; with the Jigsaw killer testing elaborate ways of pitting people against each other and killing the ones he doesn’t deem worthy of living, the killer has been dead since a decade. So when police detectives Halloran (Callum Keith Rennie) and Hunt (Clé Bennett) stumble upon murders committed in a similar fashion, with elaborate death-traps, they think that the infamous killer John Kramer (Tobin Bell) is back from the dead.<br><br>With the 'Saw' series, the main thing what one would look out for are the infamous death traps which the victims have to overcome. In 'Jigsaw' though, it seems like the makers have run out of them and are depending heavily on the myth of John Kramer instead. That is the literally the death knell for the film because the movie introduces a story-line that is not only unusual but also improbable. Saw was fun because of the gore. Here, the brothers Peter and Michael Spierig have tried to drive the film based on a premise that doesn’t really fit. Kramer is dead, and no one else in the entire cast who seems worthy of taking his place. While the plot does work to introduce the movie to the viewers coming to the franchise for the first time, for Saw loyalists, this just doesn’t seem right. While there are some gory moments that remind you of the previous films, Jigsaw doesn’t quite get there as far as slasher films go. It’s a weak imitation of the previous films but it’s not the weakest in the franchise. <br><br><br>","2.5"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Based on the dystopian science-fiction novel by Ernest Cline, ‘Ready Player One’ is set in 2045, when people seek solace in a virtual reality world known as the ‘OASIS’ to escape their desolation. Founded by the late James Halliday (Mark Rylance), the game gives them an illusion of leading better lives instantly. Once they discover that the creator has buried an Easter egg inside the virtual-reality world, promising his fortune to whoever finds it, the treasure hunt begins. Teenager Wade Watts’ (Tye Sheridan) leads the race until his quest is disrupted by a new corporation — Innovative Online Industries (IOI), who wish to put an end to OASIS.<br><br><br><strong>Review: </strong>Wade Watts aka Parzival (his virtual avatar) is supported by his Gunter (egg hunter) friends from the OASIS like Art3mis aka Samantha (Olivia Cooke) and Aech (Lena Waithe), who help him dodge IOI CEO, Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn). Hypnotic immersive entertainment at its best, Ready Player One is classic Spielberg returning to his top form. The sci-fi adventure marks the legend’s spectacular comeback to a genre (sci-fi) that recognises him as one of its pioneering forces. The filmmaker’s astute craftsmanship and ability to seamlessly blend humanism, reality and fiction like no one else, is astounding.<br><br><br>Every common man desires to see himself as a superhero someday. We foolishly hope that our problems may miraculously disappear if we overlook them. Social media is the new-age balm that distracts us from our real woes. The digital world has a way of making you feel worthy. Spielberg’s screen adaptation of Cline’s fantasy novel that thrives on fanboy culture and nostalgia, is perhaps the most hard-hitting fictional account that mirrors reality. The film’s teenage protagonist Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) mentions how humans have learnt to ‘outlive their problems’ in 2045, having found solace in Oasis instead. This escapism leaves you shaken given our extreme reliance on technology and the digital world, today!<br><br><br>The visionary director’s remarkable quality of offering out-and-out blockbuster spectacle without compromising on the story’s relevance and human emotions continues to set him apart. Though the execution is futuristic, he moulds the 80’s pop culture references in it, while simultaneously making a social commentary on our existing scenario, thus weaving the past, present and future together in the most distinctive fashion. Acting powerhouses like Mark Rylance and Simon Pegg’s enigmatic presence further warms your heart.<br><br><br>Throughout its two and a half hours runtime, the master storyteller transports you to a world of fantasy that bears an uncanny resemblance to the world we live in today. Corporatisation, nostalgia, relationships in times of digitalisation and underneath all of that, the classic good vs bad and underdog vs mighty, age-old battle — Ready Player One is much more than the engrossing treasure hunt you believe it is. A Sci-fi film with a heart, it revolves around true love, friendship and loyalty. Not once does Spielberg’s passion for creating spectacular cinematic movie-going experience, overshadow his story’s underlying message – technology can never replace human emotions. It cleverly drives home the point that one must face reality, no matter how grim and unappealing it may seem when compared to the magical virtual world, as ‘that’s the only thing that’s real’. Buckle up and set off on this absolutely thrilling ride.<br><strong><br><br>PS: Watch the film in Imax 3D to experience the ultimate immersive entertainment you desire from it. </strong><br><br>","4"

But it soon reverts to the old threats, as the Kaiju return to wreak havoc. There are more than a few new recruits this time around: Cailee Spaeny’s Amara Namani is a valuable addition and seems to be a promising young talent to watch out for. This can’t be said about Scott Eastwood who plays a guy so reminiscent of his father Clint Eastwood; you almost hope it’s a joke. It also doesn’t help that Nate Lambert has little to no chemistry with his co-pilot Jake Pentecost.</p><p>The usually charming John Boyega plays Jake who is trying to carve his own individuality, away from his father’s fame. However, there are none of the nuances of ‘identity crisis’ seen here. Sure, he eventually gives the rousing speech expected before an apocalyptic event, but it ends up being too little, too late. Charlie Day is back as Dr Newton Geiszler, and his character is given a lot more to do beyond a nerdy and comical genius, but the transition feels rather convenient than justified. Burn Gorman’s Dr Hermann Gotliebb seems to be merely going through the motions.</p><p>The humour in this sequel is terribly forced as it focuses mostly on franchise-building pegs at the cost of storytelling basics. The movie seems hellbent on reminding you that it’s an action blockbuster every 5 minutes or so with battle sequences that jump right off the screen, as they should in 3D. This is the only reason to watch this on the biggest screen around. Devoid of the heart and soul of its predecessor, ‘Pacific Rim: Uprising’ aims to please hardcore fans of massive monster versus robot fights. Those seeking any depth in their action films, better look elsewhere.</p>","3"
"<div class='Normal'>Story: A family of four on a road trip spend the night at a deserted mobile home park, where they are stalked by three masked assailants out to kill and slaughter.<br><br>Review: <br>Back in 2008, 'The Strangers' added some subtext to the slasher genre; the treatment was like Japanese horror films and tense atmosphere really worked out well. Ten years later, the sequel tries to build on the same ideas. The killer trio of masked killers return, this time to haunt a family of four at a deserted trailer park. The slow pace and the lack of thrills murder the prospects of this moody horror flick. <br><br>The victims run around in circles while the stalkers chase them in plain sight. For a film that should build on tension and thrills, 'The Strangers: Prey at Night', leaves things out in the open a little too much. There is just no terror in watching people sneak up to unsuspecting victims. Perhaps they should’ve just popped out-the-blue. The pace of the film is a real killer. The narrative spends too much time establishing the idea that Kinsey’s (Bailee Madison), the youngest member of the family, teen years have bothered her parents too much. Cindy (Christina Hendricks) and Mike (Martin Henderson) her parents and Luke (Lewis Pullman) the elder brother are driving her to a new boarding school. And their conversations on smoking, junior league baseball and mobile phones are a little too drab. The action kicks in once they encounter the killers – Dollface, Man in the Mask and Pin-Up Girl. But the eerie tension gives way to victims running around like headless chicken, tripping over props and falling prey to the killers, a little too conveniently.<br><br>The highlight in this otherwise pedantic slasher fest is a scene near the swimming pool. Luke the brother gets stabbed by the Man in the Mask and the camera does a Michael Mann style intimate capture of the whole scene with splashing water, blood and emotions. Bonnie Tyler’s 80s hit number, Total Eclipse of the Heart plays in the background and the sequence just feels surreal. The cinematography and the production design create the right atmosphere for the scares. But for all its technical finesse, this 85-minute film feels a little too long.<br>","2.5"
"<div class='Normal'><p><strong>Gringo Story</strong><strong>: </strong>An American businessman finds himself crossing the line from a law-abiding citizen to a criminal.</p><p><strong>Gringo Review:</strong> Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) puts all his trust into his boss Richard Rusk (Joel Edgerton), whom he considers as his friend. Little does he know that Richard, along with his partner in business, crime, and otherwise – Elaine Markinson played by Charlize Theron, has other plans in mind. When the three of them take a trip to their company’s factory in Mexico, Harold gradually begins to learn the truth about his supposed friend and the company he works for. He’s left to choose between being a law-abiding citizen or a criminal on the run.</p><p>David Oyelowo is the breakout star in the ensemble cast of Joel Edgerton, Charlize Theron, Sharlto Copley, Thandie Newton and Amanda Seyfried. His rendition of Harold Soyinka as an everyman forced to face dire circumstances is pretty much how any of us would react to chaos and life-threatening scenarios. Harold is relatable and entirely out of his element trying to stay alive as his life falls apart around him. He’s the driving force of the comedy, and it wouldn’t work if he weren’t an affable chap. Other than him, it’s hard to like the rest of the characters. Joel Edgerton’s Richard Rusk is a smug, know-it-all cocky boss who doesn’t have much respect for those around him. He would qualify as a shark if not for Elaine Markinson. Charlize Theron is absolutely fierce as the downright selfish, unfiltered and politically incorrect Elaine who doesn’t pretend to be anything else. Sharlto Copley’s versatility is on full display as Mitch Rusk, who is hard to pinpoint – you’re not sure whether to root for him or not.</p><p>‘Gringo’s biggest problem is its lack of focus, and all the additional characters don’t help. Some subplots involving Thandie Newton, Amanda Seyfried and Harry Treadaway are not off the mark but feel unnecessary. Director Nash Edgerton is definitely inspired by Quentin Tarantino’s pulpy mix of action comedy and drama – a high bar to follow, and the screenplay tends to veer off course at some crucial points. But Nash Edgerton brings it all home in the end, and that’s what really matters. ‘Gringo’ is far from groundbreaking, but it’s a fun watch that will put some Bollywood masala potboilers to shame.</p>","3"
"<div class='Normal'>Story: A gritty and artistic retelling of the 1976 hijacking of an Air France plane by Palestinian and German terrorists at Entebbe airport in Uganda. Israeli government and armed forces stage a far-fetched mission to rescue their citizens. <br><br>Review: <br>The Israel-Palestine conflict has been going on since the late 40s and that’s the perfect setup for filmmaker José Padilha, whose films (Elite Squad, RoboCop) have always carried a strong political undertone. With 7 Days In Entebbe, José tries to comment on the conflict and the irony around it. The story kicks off in Athens as two German militants Böse (Daniel Brühl) and Kuhlmann (Rosamund Pike) and a bunch of Palestinian freedom fighters hijack an Air France plane. They take the plane and it’s French, Israeli and other European passengers to Entebbe airport in Uganda, where the eccentric Idi Amin (Nonso Anozie) and his forces help out in keeping the hostages captive. The setup is quite thrilling and intriguing. The film also features two parallel tracks – one featuring a Batsheva Dance Company member played by Zina Zinchenko and her boyfriend and Israeli special-ops soldier (Ben Schnetzer). The other track features the then Israel Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and his cabinet led by Defence Minister Shimon Peres (Eddie Marsan) coming up with a far-fetched plan to rescue the hostages. The multiple tracks of the story create a bit of an unnecessary distraction.<br><br>The hostage drama unfolding at Entebbe airport has a lot going for it. Idi Amin’s eccentricities and the melancholy and conflict between Daniel Brühl, Rosamund Pike and their Palestinian partners make for some good drama. While the dance troupe’s performance added some thump to the proceedings it just feels a little too ambiguous and obscure. The office drama between the Israeli PM and his ministers and military advisors just doesn’t add any thrill to the narrative. Brühl and Pike the film with genuine emotional moments. Eddie Marson gives a robust performance as well. The only major hiccup is the deliberate slow pace of the film. It takes a little too much time to show the passage of time at Entebbe airport as the seven days slowly build up the tension in the hostage situation. <br><br>7 Days In Entebbe has some interesting moments from the past featuring ex-Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu and his elder brother Yoni Netanyahu. For those who follow world politics and the Middle-East closely, this film offers compelling insights with strong artistic sensibilities.<br>","3"

When we first meet him, he’s dignified, calm and collected. A dramatic incident at the start of the film pushes him out of his comfort zone, and his manicured lifestyle begins to unwind. It’s near impossible to predict what will happen next, and yet it’s oddly mesmerising to witness Christian coming apart one crazy event after the next.</p><p>Director Ruben Östlund adopts an unusual style of filmmaking in ‘The Square’. There are shots where the camera lingers on, even if there are no characters in the frame. Sounds that aren’t exactly pleasing to the ear such as a crying baby throughout a scene, and others that typically would have been edited much shorter; all make the film an unnerving watch. Östlund immerses you into a unique world – one that is actually around us if we stopped to observe what’s under the surface, and beyond the sheen of our manufactured digital presence. In one memorable sequence, Terry Notary (otherwise known for his motion-capture work in ‘Rise of the Planet of the Apes’ & ‘Avatar’) plays a performance artist, Oleg, who is unleashed in a room of posh attendees at the museum. The scene begins as being cautiously comical but soon descends into a terrifying scenario where the cast is unsure of how to react. On the other side of the screen, we’re captivated by this scenario as it illustrates the ‘bystander effect’ – a phenomenon we’ve all succumbed to, at some point in our lives.</p><p>In this manner, Östlund repeatedly picks apart our perception of class, race and self-righteousness. Along with Claes Bang, Elisabeth Moss, Dominic West and Terry Notary, he creates an uncomfortable experience on multiple levels, infused with dark comedy. Over the course of 2 hours 30 minutes, ‘The Square’ will either leave you wondering what you witnessed or question the principles you choose to live by. It’s disconcerting, and certainly not everyone’s cup of tea, but if you’re up for cinema that isn’t run-of-the-mill, ‘The Square’ is undoubtedly out-of-the-box.</p>","3.5"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>STORY: <br></strong>A true story of three Americans who foiled a train hijacking in Paris in 2015. <br><br><br><strong>REVIEW: <br></strong>'The 15:17 to Paris' is Clint Eastwood taking another shot at recreating on celluloid, heroic moments from real life. This time, the veteran filmmaker deals with the subject of an actual hijacking of a train in Paris by a lone gunman in 2015 and how three brave Americans foiled the plan. As an experiment, Eastwood has cast the real people involved in tackling the gunman; two American soldiers Alek Skarlatos and Spencer Stone, and their friend Anthony Sadler. <br><br><br>As far as films on terrorism go, there’s not much action to be seen here. The entire train attack lasts hardly more than 15 minutes. What’s even more detrimental to the film is Eastwood interspacing the attack with the life stories of the three friends. Right from the time they were in school to the time they chose their respective vocations, the camera follows the trio trying to show that how absolutely normal people can rise above their stature in life and do big things. But this attempt to match all the pieces of the puzzle until the climax hits the viewers does not work in the interest of the film. It just seems like you’re waiting for a payoff that doesn’t quite arrive. The big moment of the film is the actual footage of the French President François Hollande honouring the Americans along with others who helped take-on the hijacker. The filmmaker must have thought that this will be his big money-shot, confounding viewers with footage of an actual prime minister giving out the awards, but that doesn’t work. The reason it doesn't is that you observe that there were other people who were just as important in subduing the hijacker and were mentioned in the film only in passing. <br><br><br>From a Clint Eastwood directorial, one expects better. Alas, this one is relegated to being merely an experiment in casting. <br>","3"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> A federal agent and meteorologist team up to stop a daring heist in the US Department of the Treasury as a hurricane threatens to destroy the area<br><br><strong>Review:</strong> As a category 5 hurricane looms over the sleepy town of Gulfport, Alabama, residents are compelled to evacuate the area by local authorities. Meteorologist Will Rutledge (Toby Kebbell), who has been sent to collect reports on the approaching storm, is trying to convince his brother Breeze (Ryan Kwanten) to leave town with him. On the other hand, Agent Casey (Maggie Grace), who is in charge of transporting old currency notes to the US Department of the Treasury, is unaware that there has been a massive internal security breach. Using the hurricane as an opportunity to break into the treasury is a team of crooks, led by Agent Perkins (Ralph Ineson). As circumstances bring Will and Casey together, they have to not only figure out ways to stop $600 million from being taken out of the facility, but also save their own lives as the hurricane unleashes its fury and the bad guys threaten to kill them. <br>The script rarely gives you a moment to think beyond what you’re watching on screen. Director Rob Cohen does a good job of keeping the pace swift while most characters do justice to their roles. Grace stands out as the agent hell-bent on outwitting Perkins and his gang. Kebbell and Kwanten, as two brothers separated by a childhood tragedy, but still fond of each other, are interesting to watch as they rekindle their bond. <br>The action, though not outstanding, does its job while the special effects competently show the destruction the mighty hurricane is capable of. Thankfully, there is no forced romance between any of the characters — something that we’re often saddled with at the end in thriller flicks. Although predictable in some parts — the flashback at the start of the film in this case — you don’t mind overlooking it. Keeping in mind how several US states were in the news last year for being battered by a string of hurricanes, this film shows us just how devastating they can be. More than just a regular ‘save the earth’ film, this one combines an offbeat plot with some decent special effects to make it an interesting watch. <br><br>","3.5"

Based on the success of the game’s reboot in 2013, the time seemed appropriate to focus on Lara Croft’s abilities as a female adventurer, rather than her status as a sex symbol. To say that Alicia Vikander had big boots to fill would be an understatement. Then again, Vikander is more than capable as an actress, with an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress (‘Danish Girl’) in her belt. She takes on the physically demanding role in this live-action revision of the franchise with ease, erasing any trace of her on-screen predecessor.</p><p>This version of Lara Croft is emotionally vulnerable and devoid of superhuman abilities. She needs to use her intellect and courage to overcome the challenges ahead of her. Vikander keeps us invested enough through Lara Croft’s transformation from a naive, hesitant girl to a confident woman who isn’t afraid of taking risks. But in establishing her roots, the film resorts to some of the clichéd tropes of an origin tale. As a result, the plot is often predictable and logically convenient to push the story forward. <span>T</span>here’s also the problem of the generic villain Vogel, played by Walton Goggins, who doesn’t feel sufficiently threatening to be taken seriously.</p><p>On the other hand, Dominic West as Lord Richard Croft brings in enough emotional resonance as Lara’s father to make her motivations well-justified as their scenes together are essential to the plot. Although the clunky screenplay results in uneven pacing issues that make for a sloppy watch<span>, the action is compelling enough to see you through. If only it didn’t rely so heavily on snappy editing, it would be even more thrilling. These choices by director Roar Uthaug hold the movie back from being an intense experience. But ‘Tomb Raider’ does enough to reignite the franchise onscreen by giving its protagonist a timely and relevant overhaul to confidently launch Alicia Vikander as this generation’s Lara Croft.</span></p>","3.5"
"<div class='Normal'>Story: A doctor decides to take revenge on those who brutally attacked his family<br><br>Review: A remake of the popular 1974 film of the same name starring the late Charles Bronson in the lead, both films are inspired by a book written by Brian Garfield. In this version, Dr Paul Kersey (Bruce Willis) leads a busy yet content life with his wife Lucy Kersey (Elisabeth Shue) and daughter Jordan (Camila Morrone) in Chicago. As someone who regularly tends to crime victims as part of his daily routine in the ER, Paul is used to hearing tales about the felonies that increasingly plague the area. However, his world is turned upside down when his own family is brutally assaulted, leaving him distraught and aching for revenge. As he embarks on a mission to discover the perpetrators, Paul unleashes his fury on not just those who hurt him but even those who wrong others.<br><br>While the story is quite straightforward, it also tends to be predictable and doesn’t keep you engaged throughout. You also can’t help but wonder whether the makers were right in releasing the film at this point in time — when gun violence is at an all-time high in America. In fact, there are moments where you find yourself wondering whether Paul’s rampage is even justified. The emotional connect is sketchy and the action sequences seem sluggish at best. Director Eli Roth doesn’t have a robust script to begin with, which leads to some unintentionally funny scenes. <br><br>Willis does a decent job as the man avenging his family’s torture but this isn’t one of his best performances by a long shot. Although he showcases a range of emotions — from shock and guilt to rage and retribution — he’s let down by the script. Among the supporting cast, Frank Kersey (Vincent D’Onofrio) playing Paul’s brother is the only one who stands out. The bad guys aren’t menacing enough, making one wish more attention was paid to the casting. There are moments towards the end where you find yourself on the edge of your seat, silently rooting for the veteran actor as he goes about his job but unfortunately, it’s too late by then. You can give this a watch if you enjoy revenge dramas and are a Bruce Willis fan. <br>","3"

Now, a successful CEO of his company in San Francisco with two loving daughters and a beautiful wife, life could not have been any better for him. But when his youngest daughter Maya (Agneeta Thacker) commits suicide, we get to know that all is not well with the picture-perfect family. As a means of trying to make sense of the tragedy, Neal traces back the movements of Maya in her last months to find out just why, his seemingly ‘normal’ daughter, in a family that resembles the definition of the American Dream, would take her own life.<br><br>As far as performances are concerned, almost all cast has done a fine job. Ally Khan is convincing as the grieving father and has underplayed the dramatic role. Suchitra Pillai as a housewife, who has some secrets of her own, is also up to the mark as someone who is constantly torn between fulfilling her duties as a mother and a wife versus what she owes herself as a woman. Agneeta Thacker, who has mainly worked on American films and TV shows, too, is perfectly cast as the timid girl who tries her best to keep everyone around her happy, yet succumbs to the pressures of being a young adult.<br><br>And while the filmmaker is asking the right questions when it comes to teen-suicides, but the manner in which she says it, is not that interesting. While you empathise with Neal as the bereaved father, it is tough to be interested in his journey. Also ambiguous is the manner at which he arrives at the conclusion of what it was that took the life of his daughter. It’s almost as if he is chasing several dead ends, yet deriving a vague meaning from them all. The whole angle about how technology is driving people further away has just been given lip-service by the filmmaker. About its emotional depth, ‘The Valley’ is definitely not among the important films that deal with the concept of death and loss.<br><br>","2"

An air of mystery surrounds every character and their intentions, which ups the intrigue and paranoia.</p><p>However, without any substantial gains at stake, Domenika’s ‘sexual sacrifices’ and manipulative games seem inconsequential. Even the sparrow training programme or in JLaw’s own words (whore school) which expects her to endure the perverse and sadistic activities, ends up looking dim-witted instead of dangerous. You chuckle when the instructor tells the new recruits in a stern voice, “Your body belongs to the state now.”</p><p>A torture porn with the sensibility of a 50 Shades… like erotic fantasy, Red Sparrow fails to take flight as the chilling spy thriller, you’d expect it to be. Even a decent climax is unable to salvage a sluggish buildup.

"<div class='Normal'><p><strong>Lady Bird Story</strong>: Set in 2002, a teenage girl discovers herself through love, relationships and the city of Sacramento, California.</p><p><strong>Lady Bird Review</strong>: It’s evident that Greta Gerwig takes a lot of inspiration from her own life in ‘Lady Bird’. In her solo directorial debut based on her original screenplay, she draws from these experiences to make the film genuine and honest. There are familiar setups of the ‘coming-of-age’ genre – a classic one sees lead character Christine, who goes by the name Lady Bird, falling in love with a guy from school only to end up heartbroken when she catches him cheating on her. But the way the scenario plays out is far from typical. Just as life is full of surprises, Lady Bird gets to experience a lot of them along the way, taking us along for the ride.</p><p>The realism is hammered down through all the performances, mainly by Saoirse Ronan as Christine/ Lady Bird. Ronan captures the angst, confusion and determination of a teenager on a journey of self-discovery. She is perfectly cast as the temperamental, restless girl who begins to understand what it means to look beyond yourself. Lady Bird believes she is better off away from Sacramento, forgetting that her parents are financially struggling to make ends meet. This sets up the plot for a lot of friction with her mother, leading to the most prominent angle – the mother-daughter relationship. Even though the narrative revolves around Ronan, it’s Laurie Metcalf who often steals the show as Marion who is, in essence, the adult version of Lady Bird. Equally strong-willed to the point of being obstinate, Metcalf is hilarious, yet firm as a mother who pokes holes in her daughter’s self-obsessive bubble.</p><p>Besides the two main characters, Gerwig infuses a lot of personality into all the supporting roles, making each one of them essential to the plot. Although they might seem to be forgetful, Gerwig ensures that their parts are not merely decorative, and far from stereotypical. The credit goes to her writing skills and ability to present a collection of memories from someone’s teenage years without being pretentious, or melodramatic for the sake of cheap laughs or tears. Just like the protagonist, ‘Lady Bird’ is awkwardly funny yet bittersweet, making it one of Hollywood’s most original and refreshingly honest films about growing up.</p>","4.0"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:<br></strong>A couple who is excessively addicted to playing board games find themselves trapped in a game night that is as unexpected as it is dangerous.<br><br><strong>Review:<br></strong>Max (Jason Bateman) and Annie (Rachel McAdams) are two board-game addicts who bond and later marry over their love of competitive gaming. Be it Jenga, Monopoly, Scrabble or Dumb Charades; there is no game they won’t indulge in over the weekends with their friends. One fine day, Max’s elder and more successful brother Brooks (Kylie Chandler) shows up and hosts a game at his swanky pad causing the ever-competitive Max to go in an overdrive. Now he has to win, to get back for all those years of losing to his elder, smarter brother. However, they are not playing silly board games anymore as Brooks arranges for a life-like kidnapping scenario where the players have to track him as he gets kidnapped by fake goons by following clues left around the house. The real thrill begins though, when they realise that the kidnapping is very real and that the goons carry actual guns and that this is not a game anymore.<br><br>It’s a joy when a film doesn’t take itself so seriously, yet remains committed steadfastly to its goofiness, and 'Game Night' is one such film. The scene where Brooks is being thrashed around the house as the other participants binge on cheese and snacks as they appreciate the ‘life-like’ thrashing that Brooks is being subjected to is one among the several hilarious moments in the film. The characters are all so close to actual physical danger as the game gets real makes for some thrilling moments. But even when they do realise that the situation is indeed dire, the filmmakers dial-up the craziness a notch and the tense ride becomes even more fun. The jokes in the film are tight, the action is slick and the dark moments are made so funny by the excellent writing that you never get bored and can never guess what may come next. The side-splitting situational comedy that the film indulges in is refreshing and genuinely hilarious.<br><br>The filmmaker duo John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein employ the same irreverence they used when they co-wrote 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' and deliver a ludicrous laugh-riot with 'Game Night'. So go ahead and revel in the craziness of this film as it takes you for a sweet, silly ride.<br><br>","3.5"

He directs his own original screenplay which initially appears to be a familiar setup; a mother seeking revenge for her daughter’s gruesome rape and murder takes on inept, corrupt cops. But, the film gingerly walks a fine line between a really dark comedy and a hard punch to the guts, playing out in extremely unpredictable ways.</p><p>Facing backlash from almost an entire town, Mildred represents those prepared to face all odds in defense of the ones they love. Although her anger is absolutely justified, Mildred’s choices are heartbreaking and even frustrating at times. Frances McDormand plays her as a steely, determined and ruthless woman whose quest for vengeance makes her do things that will leave some people sitting on the fence about her character. The main target of Mildred’s aggression is Chief Willoughby played by Woody Harrelson. While the police force is shown as a group of small-town people trying to uphold the law according to their own narrow-minded perspectives, Willoughby indicates there’s more than what meets the eye. This is also the best way to describe Dixon played by Sam Rockwell as an incompetent, insensitive boor probably unfit for society, let alone the police force. But a turning point brings out another angle that challenges your opinions of him, bolstered by Rockwell’s eclectic performance in the most distinctive character arc in the film.</p><p>‘Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri’ poses an intriguing moral dilemma – can revenge be as bad as the crime itself? It also looks at how tragedy can affect different people, but its biggest achievement is in testing your perspective of how quickly we tend to judge people without knowing what truly drives them. One of the movies that could easily fly under the radar if it wasn’t receiving all the awards buzz, ‘Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri’ is an unassuming film that surprises you with its provocative subject matter and evocative performances that are hard to forget.</p>","4"

On the way, they encounter a woman Rosalie Quaid (Rosamund Pike) who is coming to terms with the harsh world of New Mexico at that time, especially at the hands of ruthless Comanche raiders. The emotional struggles of Captain Joseph Blocker and Rosalie Quaid are documented in the form of powerful and measured performances by Christian Bale and Rosamund Pike respectively. Christian Bale completely disappears into Blocker and his anger, pain, and weariness are palpable. Rosamund Pike is nuanced and layered as a woman recovering from severe trauma. Pike brings out Rosalie’s grief and strength in equal measure.</p><p>Wes Studi is known for playing powerful and stoic types with a stark and rugged visage that looks war-torn by default. His portrayal of Chief Yellow Hawk is fitting but you wish you got to know this character a little better. In fact, that’s one of the biggest problems with ‘Hostiles’. In a film about Native American suffering at the hands of White oppressors, the screenplay fails to give more insight into the oppressed, especially when they’re so wonderfully intriguing. Besides the gripping performances by Bale and Pike, the cinematography is gritty enough to draw you into this stark world. However, with the runtime going beyond the two-hour mark, there are some points when your interest might be challenged, and that’s unfortunate with this strong cast.</p><p>18<sup>th</sup> century America was a time when survival pretty much came down to kill, or be killed. ‘Hostiles’ captures this constant threat beautifully, with riveting moments of action and drama making it hard to predict who will make it out in the end. But amidst great performances and gorgeous cinematography, ‘Hostiles’ misses the mark by giving us just an overview of its real subject matter.</p>","3.5"

Ironically, while the creature is trapped and tortured by Strickland for being dangerous, it is that very monster that’s most compassionate when it comes to Elisa. He sees her and acknowledges her existence unlike the rest. The creature makes her feel alive and worthy of being loved — something we all yearn for.<br><br><br>Leading the Oscar race with 13 nominations, on paper, Guillermo del Toro’s implausible love story may seem a tad preposterous. However, its beauty lies in the filmmaker’s vivid imagination and unique execution. Through sublime storytelling, evocative characters, spectacular production design and Alexandre Desplat’s soul-stirring music, del Toro’s suspenseful romance, transports you to another place and time. In times of growing cynicism and practicalities seeping into relationships, this enchanting fairy-tale with a hint of realism, is an exquisite piece of cinema that compels you to believe in miracles.<br><br><br>Right from the word go; the visionary filmmaker paints a visual and emotional masterpiece that strikes an incredible balance between reality and fantasy. Elisa’s banal existence and longing for an unusual adventure, her modest apartment placed on top of a movie theatre and unspoken conversation with her only friends Giles (Richard Jenkins), an elderly gay man craving for companionship and Zelda (Octavia Spencer), a caring woman, constantly cribbing about her useless husband Bruester… it is precious moments like these that resonate with you the most. Also, the actors — Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, Michael Shannon and Michael Stuhlbarg breathe life into this fantasy.<br><br><br>More than its visual brilliance, what captivates you the most is Del Toro’s ability to capture the minutiae of his ordinary characters’ everyday life.

One day, as his father leaves him and his mom to go work in the big city, life is fun no more. Gone are the days when he would sing and chase animals in his village. The boy decides to take matters in his own hand and packs his bag to track his father and get him back.</p><p>There is minimal dialogue in the film but that hardly matters because the film deftly manages to convey emotions through its unique animation style. The characters that we see, be it the frivolous young parader who helps the boy, or the old man and the dog, who accompany the boy along his journey, are an exciting mix of people who enrich his journey. Topics like urbanisation, pollution, the plight of ageing workers and just how technology and automation are still affecting small as well as big cities are all discussed in the film effectively. Even though the language is Portuguese, one would not even need to glance at the subtitles to relate to the tale as it is universal in nature. Maybe that’s the reason it was nominated for Oscars in the animation category last year.</p><p>On the surface, ‘Boy and the World’ looks like an animated film from the seventies that uses the very basic, line drawing animation technique. But just a few moments into the film, you realise that this is just a ploy, and a very effective one at that, which director Alê Abreu uses to a great effect. Since the film is told from a child’s perspective, Abreu has used a simple animation technique which looks like scribbles by a child, and elevates it by using a mesmerising mix of drawing, painting and digital animation to achieve incredible effects. The music — a mix of carnival tunes to sad mono-tones that are both haunting and euphoric at the same time — stays with you long after the film is over.</p><p>This colourful joyride is one that we insist you make and see the world through the eyes of a little boy.</p>","3.5"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>A powerful enemy challenges T’Challa’s rightful place as King of Wakanda and the Black Panther putting him, the fate of his nation, and the entire world at risk.<br><br><strong>Review:</strong> ‘Black Panther’ has the unenviable task of being the precursor to Marvel’s massive comic book film event scheduled later this year in ‘The Avengers – Infinity War’. But writer & director Ryan Coogler is no stranger to taking on big responsibilities, proving his mettle with ‘Creed’ – a spin-off/ sequel to the ‘Rocky’ series. In ‘Black Panther’, Coogler proves he is more than up for the challenge, evident by his robust screenplay that showcases a deep list of fascinating personas, making each of them stand out in their own unique ways.<br><br>Most prominently, he gives us not one but two strong antagonists. Andy Serkis lets loose as Ulysses Klaue, being as maniacal as he can get without motion capture – a welcome change for the talented actor who isn’t seen too often on camera. Besides Klaue, Killmonger presents a case for the best bad guy to come out of the Marvel stable (tying in closely with Loki). Bringing pathos to the character, Michael B. Jordan makes him menacing and powerful. But this is Black Panther’s platform to shine, and Chadwick Boseman makes it count. He plays T’Challa as a firm yet gracious ruler, with enough vulnerability to bring us a regal, affable and even relatable king. Nakia (Lupita Nyong’o) is one of the many strong women in this film; layered and more than able to pack a powerful punch. While most of the film’s tonality is somewhat more somber than Marvel’s recent outings, there’s ample humour at appropriate moments courtesy T’Challa’s sister Shuri (Letitia Wright). In fact, Coogler ensures that the female cast is loaded with enough wit and grit to be scene-stealers.<br><br>The intricacies of African culture are beautifully captured and showcased in a whole new light as vibrant costumes and set design merge with high-quality CGI spectacle. Coogler adds another layer to the tale by taking on an intriguing issue of the role global superpowers play in the real world. Inspiring and empowering in equal measure, ‘Black Panther’ is a richer & deeper experience than most comic book fare. Most importantly, the Marvel Cinematic Universe will definitely benefit from the presence of King T’Challa and his kingdom of Wakanda well down the line.<br><br>","4.0"

The interminable length of the film stretched to way over two hours is a dampener. It ensures that your mind keeps meandering and eventually makes it difficult to keep up with the incessant twists and turns in the plot. Shot on a fairly lavish scale, the special effects deserve a mention for their superiority. However, you wish director Wes Ball had gone with a more measured screenplay, which would have made the film enjoyable even for those who haven’t watched the previous two installments. The film also suffers a bit because it tries to juggle too many plot lines without being able to balance them well.<br><br>Among the cast, O’Brien stands out as the loyal friend and tormented lover, who wants to make sure his loved ones face no harm.

His meticulous lifestyle is thrown off balance when he meets a young waitress who becomes his lover and muse.<br><br><strong>Phantom Thread Review: </strong>At first glance, 'Phantom Thread' looks regal in its high society persona captured with exquisite cinematography that represents London in the 1950's. The period detail is painstakingly precise but besides the fabulous set and costume design, the background score is a character in itself. Jonny Greenwood's music perfectly compliments the era, geography & emotion of every scene, especially those that have little to no dialogue. It acts as a companion to the cryptic plot which unfolds as Paul Thomas Anderson weaves a mystery of romantic obsession around the lead pair. The journey until the final unveiling would not be half as engaging if it weren't for the brutally raw and sincere performances by the actors.<br><br>In what’s meant to be his final role, Daniel Day-Lewis creates another definitive character study. He plays Reynolds Woodcock with an air of arrogant dignity that is eventually stripped away to reveal the vulnerability underneath it . Day-Lewis gives an extremely measured performance that demands all the awards attention he’s getting. Lesley Manville constantly reminds you of her subtle yet remarkable presence as Reynolds’ sister Cyril who keeps this genius artist in check. Cyril makes sure Reynolds doesn’t walk over her the way he does with other women, while making her peace with his idiosyncrasies. But the true revelation is Vicky Krieps as Alma, the woman who breaks through the barriers Reynolds’ has built around himself. Krieps crafts Alma into a chameleon who transforms into the muse Reynolds’ wants her to be, until she decides she’s had enough.<br><br>The narrative spins around itself in ways that will test your patience. But 'Phantom Thread' questions your outlook on love and what it means to different people. It looks at how people tailor themselves in accordance with those they love. When a work of art is created and put out there, does it still belong to its creator, or is it owned by the audience and consumer? How much is an artist able to compromise on for the sake of his/ her craft? All these questions make ‘Phantom Thread’ sometimes challenging to experience but intriguing as it explores the depths of our obsession with the concept of love itself.<br>","4.0"
"<div class='Normal'><p><strong>Story:</strong> Based on a true story, the American war drama revolves around US’ counter attack on the Taliban post 9/11. In order to infiltrate the Taliban stronghold in Afghanistan, a Special Forces team of 12 is deployed to the ‘graveyard of many empires’. Led by Captain Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth), the 12 American soldiers must team up with Afghan warlord General Dostum (Navid Negahban) and his allied Afghan rebels to take on the Taliban.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong> Nicolai Fuglsig’ retelling of this near impossible dangerous covert mission is unnerving and atmospheric. The depiction of loss of innocent lives, incessant gunfire and bombings that engulf war-torn Afghanistan, literally make you watch over your shoulder to ensure you are safe and that is the kind of impact you expect from a war drama. The execution is loaded with intrigue and that keeps you going, even when the pace drops. Even the actors deliver a fine performance, which enhances the narrative. Seeing Chris ‘Thor’ Hemsworth as a super soldier instead of a superhero, who wields the gun instead of swinging his hammer, comes as a refreshing change.</p><p>Michael Shannon and Michael Peña too make their presence felt. But of the lot, it is Navid Negahban, who steals the show with his earnest portrayal of Dostum — an Afghan rebel with a cause. Nelson’s change in perception of war and its aftermath, after facing the ground reality is what affects you the most. You see the film through his eyes and can relate to his psychological upheaval and the post-war ramifications that affect the soldiers and survivors so deeply.</p><p>However, despite the many pluses, what doesn’t work in the film’s favour is its hasty climax that makes the Afghan war look a tad flimsy, dramatic and way too convenient. While the tension is maintained brilliantly throughout, we wish the ending was as gripping or effective.</p><p>Overall, if you are keen to watch a war film that blends 19th century warfare (cavalry) with modern weaponry, latest technology and human emotions overcoming the horrors of war, you’ll like this real-life epic tale.</p>","3.5"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>A regular, mundane daily commute turns deadly when an insurance salesman gets entangled in a criminal conspiracy <br><br><strong>Review: </strong>Michael MacCauley (Liam Neeson) leads a contented family life and has been taking the same train to his office in New York City since the past 10 years. Things seem to be going fine when he suddenly faces financial insecurity and confides in his friend and ex-colleague, Detective Alex Murphy (Patrick Wilson). Back on the train, MacCauley is accosted by a stranger — a woman by the name of Joanna (Vera Farmiga) — who makes him an offer too tempting to resist.<br><br>What follows next is a race against time as MacCauley faces the daunting task to save his family and uncover a web of lies. When you’re going for a Liam Neeson film, you go expecting some high octane action. And while this film may not have non-stop fast paced action, you won’t be disappointed with The Commuter either. Certain scenes have you on the edge of your seat and you’re frequently left wracking your brains along with MacCauley to figure out how to unravel this mystery.<br><br>Neeson, of course, is superb as the ex-cop-turned-insurance salesman, who finds himself caught in an incredible web of lies and deceit. Farmiga is impressive as the woman who traps an unsuspecting MacCauley. Wilson has a limited number of scenes but stands out with his character. The fluid camera work ensures that the fight sequences are seamless and believable. The film also captures the NYC subway culture, which in some ways, is similar to the daily commute in large Indian cities where we have a set of travel buddies.<br><br>Director Jaume Collet-Serra, who has teamed up with Neeson for the fourth time for the big screen, does a fine job of keeping the viewer engrossed thanks to a taut script, unexpected twists and turns, and solid performances by the lead actors. There is rarely a moment when the film loses momentum and you’re left guessing till the end. Overall, if you’re in the mood for some intrigue and mystery, and of course, are a Neeson fan, this one makes an interesting watch. <br>","3.5"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Things go horribly wrong when teenager Clare Shannon discovers a mysterious Chinese musical box that grants her seven wishes.<br><br><strong>Review:</strong> What would you do if you were granted seven wishes? Seventeen-year-old Clare Shannon (Joey King) is faced with this enticing dilemma when she finds a mystical music box that claims to dole out seven wishes. A typical high school student with the hots for the most popular boy in class, Paul Middlebrook (Mitchell Slaggert), who doesn’t even know she exists, Clare is also a target for Darcie, who constantly belittles her in public. Clare’s father Jonathan (Ryan Phillipe) is a dumpster-scavenging hoarder, who although affectionate, has little time for his daughter. Going through the normal angst associated with teenage years, she unwittingly makes her first wish where she hopes that Darcie ‘rots’. As she realises that the mysterious box indeed grants wishes, Clare gets seduced by its powers and starts making wishes. Unfortunately, things start to go awfully wrong. <br><br>While the storyline seems promising in the beginning, things soon become rather predictable and you can almost correctly guess what Clare will wish for. Leonetti’s direction fails to keep you gripped, which is strange considering he made the spooky Annabelle, and sticks to stereotypical situations that don’t even startle you because you see them coming from a mile away. Joey as the tormented Clare does her best to salvage a character that hasn’t really been properly sketched but after some time you don't even feel sorry for what she's going through. Some plot points like Clare's mother's suicide aren't clearly explained and raise more questions than answer them. Phillipe, playing the dad who loves to hoard, seems wasted in a role that contributes little to the script. <br><br>Although Wish Upon claims to be a teen horror flick, it fails to engage you or for that matter, bring on the jitters thanks to below average acting by its lead actors, mediocre direction and a weak script. Incidentally, the most alarming part of the film is the fact that it hopes to become a franchise. If you’re a fan of the horror genre, you might want to see the film but if you aren’t, you can skip this not-so-scary fest. <br><br>","2"
"<div class='Normal'><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Paul and Audrey Safranek (Matt Damon and Kristen Wiig) choose to go for a procedure called ‘Downsizing’, where human beings are shrunk to 5 inches and live ideal lives in gated communities. However things don’t go as planned for the couple.</p><p><strong>Review</strong></p><p>As a solution to the effects of overpopulation and impending climate change, scientists have come up with a revolutionary procedure called ‘Downsizing’, where people can be shrunk to 5 inches. This means fewer resources are consumed, the pollution reduced and people get a chance to live a lavish lifestyle than their big counterparts because a mere $100,000 is transformed to $12,00,000 when you are transformed. The small world seems ideal, with the only catch being; the procedure is irreversible. Paul and Audrey Safranek, a middle class, cash-strapped couple opt to go for the procedure for a better life in a gated community of small people called Leisureland, but Audrey develops cold feet right after Paul has been shrunk. Now, Paul is even more depressed and lives the same dull life he previously lived until he meets his hard partying roommate Dusan (Christoph Waltz) and his Vietnamese dissident maid, Ngoc Lan Tran (Hong Chau). While Dusan lives lavishly and wants Paul to be happy with the material things around him, Lan Tran takes him to the poorer part of Leisureland which slowly transforms him.</p><p>‘Downsizing’ is a very different film by Alexander Payne who has previously made ‘Nebraska’ and ‘The Descendants’. Sure the dark humour is present like the previous two films, but on this one, he has really taken the microscope to the subject of downsizing humans. While our technology could one day save us, can we as humans overcome our emotions and our behaviour in the face of doom? While the subject matter is heavy, the humour provided by Christoph Waltz and Hong Chau keeps things light. The chemistry between Matt Damon, as the simple do-gooder and Hong Chau as the feisty political dissident is hilarious and moving at times. The attention to detail in each scene, like when the downsized humans are picked up with a spatula or when they smuggle giant vodka bottles tied to a miniature sailboat, are a delight to watch.</p><p>This is one film that looks at a much bigger problem when it comes to shrinking humans than any previous film on the subject. While it dithers in what it wants to eventually say, it is certainly a fun watch.</p>","3.5"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Paddington 2 Story: </strong>Paddington takes up odd jobs in order to pay for a gift for his aunt Lucy’s 100th birthday, which lands him in all sorts of trouble.<br><br><strong>Paddington 2 Review: </strong>Picking up after the first film, Paddington has now become a member of the Brown family and is well integrated into their neighborhood. For his aunt’s 100th birthday, he sets his heart on a pop-up book but as he can’t afford it, the little bear takes up window-washing to make some money. Setting the film in motion, the book gets stolen and Paddington is wrongly framed for the robbery ending up in prison. Paddington and his family now need to clear his name and catch the real thief.<br><br>As plots go, this is as simple as they come but don’t let that fool you as this film has a lot to offer. To begin with, the ensemble cast features some of the best actors in the UK, along with cameos from a number of familiar faces. They are all clearly having fun in a film where hamming it up is more than welcome, although Hugh Bonneville as Henry Brown has the most scene-stealing moments. Once Paddington goes to prison, we’re introduced to a bevy of odd characters. Brendan Gleeson as Knuckles McGinty – the prison cook, is particularly hot-tempered and grizzly but Paddington’s interactions with him are absolutely delightful. Amongst all the talent, Hugh Grant ends up being the most versatile of the lot, donning various personas as Phoenix Buchanan – an actor way past his prime, and with a hidden agenda. Of course, none of this would work without Ben Whishaw whose voice acting as Paddington reconfirms why he’s perfectly suited for the role.<br><br>Writer-director Paul King draws a lot of inspiration from Wes Anderson’s works in this film’s cinematography with symmetrical framing and vivid color palettes. The animation is top-notch with some awe-inspiring sequences that celebrate King’s version of London. Sure there are a lot of illogical and convenient series of events but they don’t seem out of place in a world where it’s perfectly normal for a talking bear to be accepted by society. Besides the hilarious slapstick comedy, ‘Paddington 2’ really excels in conveying its messages about accepting outsiders and always looking for the good in people. This sequel is funnier, more charming and heartwarming than the original; one you’ll enjoy tremendously, with or without kids in tow. Make sure you stay behind for the credits!<br><br>","4.0"
"<div class='Normal'><p><strong>The Post Story: </strong>Steven Spielberg directs Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks in a historical drama about the controversial publication of the Pentagon Papers in the early 70’s.</p><p><strong>The Post Review: </strong>Fuelled by the turn of events in the US over the past year, Spielberg put together this high-profile project in a tight 6 months from shoot to screen. For this task, he assembled some of the finest character actors working in Hollywood today, bringing heavy-hitters Hanks and Streep together for the first time on-screen. All these talented individuals sparkle in a blend of classic storytelling – something that only an auteur like Spielberg could pull off in such a quick turnaround time.</p><p>To make this story resonate with more impact, writers Josh Singer and Liz Hannah choose to slowly ramp up the pace to a provocative finale. All the essential exposition makes the journey slightly taxing in the first act, but there are ample nuggets of brilliant performances and filmmaking artistry on display that compel you to see it through. Spielberg’s touch is evident in every frame, with exceptional camera movement and scene-blocking that should be taught in film schools. Punctuated by John William’s swelling score, pivotal acting moments are aplenty. As expected, Streep and Hanks lead the charge as the Washington Post’s publisher Katherine Graham, and editor Ben Bradlee respectively. The two cinematic stalwarts are mesmerizing to watch but Streep overshadows the rest of the predominantly male cast, outshining them all at every turn. Graham’s character arc is perhaps the most rewarding as she comes to terms with the power bestowed upon her by chance. Hanks plays against type as the blunt, no-nonsense editor whose journalistic integrity is decisive in the series of events. But in a film filled with strong performances, Bob Odenkirk is particularly memorable as assistant managing editor Ben Bagdikian.</p><p>‘The Post’ goes beyond chastising clickbaity media sensationalism and serves as a stark reminder of the purpose of the press in any democracy. This allows the message of the film to transcend boundaries, and inspire newsmakers across nations to remember <i>who </i>the press serves in the end. Granted, some of it might be a bit hard on the nose, but Spielberg knows there could not be a better time to address freedom of speech, especially when it is challenged on a daily basis. Similiar to a handwritten letter that takes its time, ‘The Post’ is not a standard thrilling political drama but comes home in the end in another essential addition to the filmography of an influential filmmaker.</p>","4.0"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>An origin tale of sorts, the fourth instalment in the Insidious series actually works as the first part of the horror franchise that leads us to Insidious (2010).

To help out a man who claims to feel the existence of a demon, Elise must visit her childhood house, where she faced physical and psychological assault at the hands of her own father. This rakes up her traumatic past and the demon she allegedly allowed to unleash as a child. How she tackles this harrowing situation forms the story.<br><br>Adam Robitel takes over from James Wan, one of the most successful horror filmmakers of today, who directed the previous two hit films and writer-actor Leigh Whannell, who directed the third, to give us this unexciting remake that fails to go beyond the tried and tested jump scares and vision of Wan. While the ‘further, red door and bodies acting as vessels for evil spirits’ managed to keep us hooked the first two times, it’s way too predictable the fourth time around. You also desperately miss the presence of Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne, the faces of Insidious, and the drama they brought to the supernatural occurrences.<br><br>Lin Shaye, who has been a constant in all four instalments lends credibility to the series including this film but it’s about time, the makers either reinvent or end the series. That or get Wan back to helm the series as a director, when he isn’t focusing on the relatively superior Conjuring franchise and his upcoming big-ticket superhero film Aquaman.<br><br>If you aren’t familiar with the Insidious films, you might find this lantern laden, modestly budgeted ghost-fest intriguing. But if you are a diehard fan of the genre and are looking for some spine-chilling thrills and a well-made horror mystery, please look ‘further’. The Last Key is more of a final nail in the coffin for the Insidious series. Of course it has its share of a few creepy moments, but it is undoubtedly the most clichéd and inconsequentially descriptive film of the lot. In the end, it simply exhausts you more than scaring the living daylights out of you and that isn’t a good sign.<br><br>","3"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> When the Bellas decide to reunite for one last performance, they’re unprepared for the competition that awaits them.<br><br><strong>Review: </strong>A sequel to Pitch Perfect 2 and the final in the trilogy, Pitch Perfect 3 reunites the Bellas, an all-girl a cappella group for one last musical performance. Although they’ve gone in different directions since the last installment, the Bellas — Beca (Anna Kendrick), Amy (Rebel Wilson) Chloe (Brittany Snow) and the rest of the motley crew — decide to participate in a contest where the winner gets a chance to be the opening act for DJ Khaled (playing himself). The other contestants, however, soon write off them off as a juvenile band with no real talent. <br><br>There aren't as many funny scenes as you'd expect. The parallel story of Amy and her criminal father Fergus (John Lithgow) is sketchy and we wish director Trish Sie had explored more of it given the fact that she's got a fine actor like Lithgow at her disposal. While the ensemble cast does an okay job, Amy walks away with the funniest lines. Although the script comes across as slightly weak at times - how can Amy not know she has $180 million dollars in her account - the finale of the Bellas is top-notch, making you sing and sway along with them.<br><br>It doesn’t really matter if you haven’t seen any of the previous movies in the franchise — you’ll pretty much get the gist in first few scenes itself. Even if you're a fan of the series and have seen the characters grow over the years, you don't really find yourself rooting for the Bellas to win the contest. Especially when it's pretty obvious that the other groups are better than them. It's also a little difficult to connect with the characters since Sie hasn't sketched them out too well. If you're into the whole song and dance chick flick scenario, this could be a fun watch with your girl gang. The pitch might not be perfect but might appeal to fans of the franchise. <br>","3"
"<div class='Normal'><p><strong>All The Money In The World</strong> <strong>Story</strong>: 16-year-old John Paul Getty III is kidnapped. His mother desperately tries to convince his billionaire grandfather to pay the ransom.</p><p><strong>All The Money In The World</strong> <strong>Review</strong>: This crime drama by Ridley Scott is based on the real-life kidnapping of John Paul Getty III. The production experienced its own behind-the-scenes drama following allegations of sexual harassment against Kevin Spacey who had finished shooting all his scenes as Jean Paul Getty. Spacey was replaced by Christopher Plummer in the title role – a recasting that works brilliantly in the film’s favor. Not only is it great to have a veteran actor who actually looks the part of an old, and tired billionaire, but Christopher Plummer is so gripping every time he appears on screen that he erases any memory of Spacey’s involvement with the project.</p><p>In other performances, Michelle Williams gives another strong turn as the desperate and distraught mother Abigail Harris, and Romain Duris is nuanced as Cinquanta – one of the kidnappers. On the other hand, Charlie Plummer as the kidnapped son is unable to evoke the emotion required to care enough about him, while Mark Wahlberg seems to be just playing himself. Italy turns out to be an intriguing character in itself, captured in all its 70’s glory, filled with enough pasta, art, paparazzi, and scooters to transport you into that era.</p><p>Greed, frugality, and the strange nature of power are the core themes explored in this film and Ridley Scott takes his time to address the question of what really holds us hostage. He chooses a disjointed narrative style that lacks a sense of urgency warranted by a real-life story that was stranger than fiction. This results in an uneven pacing and tonality, which doesn’t take away from the fact that this is an engrossing series of events, but it might be a detrimental factor to those expecting a taut thriller. The main reason to watch ‘All the Money in the World’ is the last-minute character revamp by Christopher Plummer that makes this film worthwhile.</p>","3.5"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> The period musical drama is based on the life and times of 19th-century showman PT Barnum, who founded the famous Barnum and Bailey Circus.<br><br><br><strong>Review:</strong> The film tells Barnum’s rags to riches story and explores how his meteoric rise to fame and fortune was muddled with allegations of exploiting the disabled for his circus. However, many also argued that his vision unified the outcasts and acknowledged their existence when their own disowned them.<br><br><br>Michael Gracey has a tough job at hand as at the helm of his biopic lies a man, whose methods evoked diverse reactions. Was Barnum an opportunist who exploited the misfits or was he a humanitarian? The director takes some creative liberties but ensures he presents both sides of Barnum’s debatable success story. He makes no bones about the showman’s semi-dubious ways of making money but gives a valid explanation to support his actions. For instance, you see Barnum convincing a vertically challenged man to join his circus by telling him, “People are going to laugh anyway. You might as well make a buck.” He even questions the theatre critic who calls him the ‘purveyor of semi -fraudulent spectacles’ by saying, “When was the last time you really laughed? You are a theatre critic who finds no joy in theatre? Who’s the real fraud?”<br><br><br>The beauty of The Greatest Showman is not limited to its visual appeal – spectacular sets, acrobatic performances, dances and singing ability of its artistes, headlined by the immensely talented Hugh Jackman, who exudes Barnum’s indomitable spirit. What stands the film apart is its relevance to today’s times. It touches upon social issues like class discrimination or aversion towards human abnormalities that continue to plague our society even today.<br><br><br>Coming back to Jackman, he makes you feel for Barnum as he stays honest to his flawed character which makes him humane. Also the Aussie actor’s expertise as a musical theatre artiste makes him the The Greatest Showman indeed. His portrayal of Barnum’s constant struggle with the conservative elite, fight to fit in and get the respect he deserved, moves you to tears. He is ably supported by Michelle Williams, Zac Efron, Zendaya and Rebecca Ferguson.<br><br><br>To sum it up, Barnum’s words to a renowned Opera singer (played by Ferguson) hold true for the film as well. You may go watch this film to witness the thrill of a circus spectacle but what you also get is something real.<br><br>","4"

They soon realise that they don’t just have to play the game as the avatar versions of themselves– they need to survive it too.<br><br><strong><strong>Jumanji Review: </strong></strong>In the age of Hollywood’s obsession with franchise-building and reboots, the idea for a sequel to 1995’s ‘Jumanji’ came across as another eye-roll worthy project. However, the combination of charming actors Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Karen Gillian and Kevin Hart, made it evident that this would wind up either being a complete trainwreck, or sheer mindless fun. Fortunately, ‘Welcome to the Jungle’ falls solidly into the latter category. The chemistry between the lead cast is evident and the script makes the most of this by giving each actor moments to shine and showcase their skills while they clearly enjoy playing their characters.<br><br>Johnson’s younger persona Spencer is a nerdy guy who has lived a sheltered life and is afraid of the world. When he enters the game he takes on the avatar of a hunk with no discernible physical weakness. Johnson has fun with this switch of persona and watching him go back and forth doesn’t get old. The same goes for Jack Black who plays a self-absorbed, social media addicted teenage girl Bethany. Her switch into Black’s trademark rotund shape is the most extreme and ends up being hilarious. While Black and Johnson are engaging as they are completely cast against their typical selves, Gillian and Hart aren’t too far behind playing an awkward, insecure but intelligent girl, and an all-star jock boy trapped in a less-than-stellar body respectively.<br><br>This entire body-switch premise works on slapstick humour that’s not crass and moves quickly with ample action to ensure that the 2-hour runtime doesn’t feel bulky at any point. Granted there’s a villain problem with Bobby Cannavale’s Van Pelt being as one-dimensional as they come. It’s conveniently explained away as this is all a video game, and the same rules apply for its lack of depth. ‘Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle’ ends up being a fun, holiday film that will keep you entertained enough to make it worth your time and money.<br><br>","4.0"

It helps one understand the single-minded devotion of the swami to spread his word. Another interesting bit is when the new followers take their message to London to The Beatles. You get to see how these followers piqued the interest of one of the biggest bands ever, which helped catapult their order to overnight fame.<br><br>There are funny moments, where the guru is made to look human as he indulges in funny banter through the course of his sermons. This helps because ‘Hare Krishna!’ doesn’t delve for too long on its criticisms.

Realising that his beloved father is never going to return to the Casa Del Toro ranch after being taken away by a matador, little Ferdinand decides to run away from the violence that surrounds and saddens him. Fortunately, his escape leads him to Nina (Lily Day) and her father’s farm, who welcome Ferdinand into their home and hearts. The gentle giant is thrilled to discover a meadow where he can spend hours smelling his precious flowers along with his new family who dote on him. As time passes by, Ferdinand grows up into an impressive bull — with the biggest heart and the most genial demeanour. An unfortunate accident leads him back to the ranch he despises where he meets his old mates and makes new acquaintances. <br><br>Heartbroken about being separated from his beloved family, Ferdinand must not only win over his fellow bulls’ trust (they taunt him by calling him Flower Bull) but also figure out how to escape and reunite with his family. John Cena does a fine voice-over as the strong-willed bull who steadfastly refuses to fight a matador despite being the strongest (and biggest) animal on the ranch. Director Carlos Saldanha has efficiently woven the screenplay around Ferdinand’s enormous size and gentle disposition, which tells us that looks can be deceptive. You often find your heart melting at Ferdinand’s predicament, and laugh and sigh with him during the course of the movie. <br><br>The animation is cute and there are several scenes that will make you chuckle especially the dance off between the bulls and haughty horses, which evokes claps. Lupe (Kate McKinnon), the calming goat, who constantly eggs Ferdinand to fight despite his reluctance, is a memorable character thanks to her witty one liners. With the holiday season coming up, animated films are bound to make an appearance in cinema halls. <em>Ferdinand </em>is a fun film that doesn’t just put a smile on your face, it also has a message — you don’t have to do things just because others expect you to.

Clearly, writer & director Rian Johnson knows these questions are on every fan’s mind. But true to what Luke Skywalker says in the trailer, he does not address them the way you think. There are a lot of narrative risks taken by Johnson in ‘The Last Jedi’ and they propel the mythology in an unexpected direction.</p><p>Even with it’s two and a half hour runtime, there’s not much fluff in ‘The Last Jedi’. All the drama, action and adventure build towards something much bigger. There’s hardly a bad performance in this film, but Mark Hamill is outstanding as Luke. Now a cranky old man, Luke’s history with the Force, and Jedi have taken a toll on him and Hamill captures this essence with a pain that’s tangible. The interactions between Luke and Rey are certainly gripping, but even more intriguing are the scenes between her and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Meanwhile, the other characters – General Leia (Carrie Fisher), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), and Finn (John Boyega), all add vital aspects to the story. Johnson even introduces a few new ones with Benicio Del Toro being memorable, and Laura Dern as Vice Admiral Holdo does not disappoint. The only misstep is Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) and her equation with Finn that feels somewhat disconnected from the others.</p><p>All the technical components come together seamlessly as well. The score, editing, effects, sound design, and cinematography are well-balanced and high caliber. With some absolutely gorgeous moments that will become imprinted in every fan’s mind, ‘The Last Jedi’ is everything a Star Wars film should be, and so much more. Johnson weaves an emotionally rewarding tale while balancing all the essential sci-fi action expected, but manages to give ‘The Last Jedi’ its own heart and voice.</p>","4.0"

At the outset, this sounds like the perfect political thriller because after all – truth is stranger than fiction. Along with a reputable ensemble of actors such as Diane Lane, Michael C. Hall, Tom Sizemore, and Bruce Greenwood amongst others, it’s been a while since Liam Neeson flexed this particular set of acting skills, so this film held a lot of promise.</p><p>Unfortunately, while their performances are intriguing at best, they all appear to be misplaced in this biographical drama. Blame it largely on shoddy writing and direction by Peter Landesman, who appears to be out of his depth handling the complex series of cloak and dagger events within the short runtime of a feature-length film. Perhaps this would have worked better as a mini-series adaptation on television. What we’re left with is a rushed, and lacklustre retelling of how the White House toppled over itself trying to cover up the scandal. It sorely lacks the tension and momentum building up to Nixon stepping down, primarily because it fails to establish the gravity of the role played by Felt. Neeson tries his best to bring some emotional weight by giving us some insight into Felt’s personal life, thereby trying to uncover his motivations. But the scenes with his family come across pale and colourless, adding to the disconnect between the audience and his thought process. Diane Lane is particularly underutilized as Audrey Felt while most of the cast seemingly play their roles in isolation.</p><p>It also doesn’t help that the colour palette is consistently dark and gloomy; meant to add some sense of dread it ends up crossing the fine line into being dreary. There’s absolutely no problem with slow, measured and deliberate pacing, but when the runtime of an hour and forty-five minutes feels long-drawn, there’s a problem with engaging your audience. The result is the textbook definition of a missed opportunity.</p>","3.0"
"<div class='Normal'><p><strong>Story:</strong> An ode to the beauty of Tennis, which is rooted in its unpredictable and demanding nature, this biographical sports thriller recreates the epic ‘fire and ice’ battle between Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe in the 1980 Wimbledon final and the events that led to that iconic clash.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong> Not many sports films manage to go beyond listing down the on-field victories and defeats of an athlete. They either succumb to idol worship by revering the sportsman or solely milk the controversies that made headlines. The psychological tenacity that goes into the making of a champion is often overlooked. Janus Metz’s unnerving character study of Tennis legends Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe smartly decodes that unexplored aspect of sportsmen. What lies beneath the glories and tribulations?</p><p>Captivating from beginning to end, the film dares to unmask their contrasting temperaments — Borg’s placid demeanour and McEnroe’s volatile exterior, for us to discover how similar these two men actually were. Borg concealed his emotions so that they don’t get used against him. While it worked for him on field, it cost him his peace of mind. McEnroe on the contrary wore his heart on his sleeve and suffered for not being considered suitable to play the ‘gentleman’s sport’. The film explores this common restlessness between the two in a compelling way. However, unlike Ron Howard’s spectacular Formula One film ‘Rush’ (2013) that predominantly showcased the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, Borg McEnroe is a tad lopsided. It essentially focuses on Borg’s fears and psyche more than his competition with the hot-headed American. But you don’t mind it a bit, given how masterfully the director juxtaposes the Swede’s fierce competitiveness and superstitions with his ice cold countenance.</p><p>Keeping the physical similarities aside, Swedish actor Sverrir Gudnason deserves a standing ovation for making us (the generation that grew up on Nadal-Federer rivalry) witness the brilliance of Bjorn Borg and what made him one of the greatest male Tennis players of the open era. He makes you forget that he is an actor and not the Swedish legend. Shia LaBeouf stuns you with his performance as well. Their command over the game is simply commendable.</p><p>In quintessential Tennis lingo, Janus Metz’s biopic is a nerve-racking five-setter that leaves you gasping for breath. Like a classic centre court final, this tense and thrilling sports drama heads to a nail-biting climax, thus evoking unprecedented attention throughout. Borg’s motto – ‘One point at a time’ is also perhaps the most significant life lesson that one can take home from this stunning masterpiece that studies two men, who played to win.</p>","4"
"<div class='Normal'>Story: The film is based on Leo Tolstoy’s famous novel and narrates the tale of adultery, involving the married Countess Anna Karenina and Count Alexei Vronsky and how it affects their lives. <br><br>Review: Adapting the famous Russian novel to the big screen is no mean task and director Karen Shakhnazarov takes on the tricky job of creating the world of 19th century Russian aristocracy, replete with its hypocrisies and orthodoxy. The film begins with Anna Karenina’s son, Sergey Karenin (Kirill Grebenshchikov), a doctor in the Russian Army, treating the wounded during the war between Russia and Japan in Manchuria. A chance meeting between Sergey and Alexei Vronsky (Maksim Matveyev), his dead mother’s lover, who is now a soldier, in Manchuria leads him to question what led to their affair and her suicide. The film’s narrative hinges on Vronsky’s version of how his affair with Anna unfolded. <br><br>Mounted on a big canvas, the most redeeming aspects of the film are the set-design and the costumes. What doesn’t work is how the conflict in Anna Karenina’s (Elizaveta Boyarskaya) marriage which leads her to begin an affair with Alexei Vronsky is tackled. While Elizaveta Boyarskaya and Maksim Matveyev perform their roles competently, their chemistry is not searing enough to hook the viewer and be invested in their story. The film is tediously long and slow as well. If costume dramas of yore are your thing then you might want to catch the film at a theatre near you. But, if you are looking for an engaging adaptation of the book, then skip this one.<br><br><br>","3"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Just when Brad and Dusty have reached an understanding about how to co-parent their children, things start to unravel when their respective fathers land up to spend Xmas with them<br><br><strong>Review: </strong>After a rocky start and reluctantly becoming pals at the end of the first movie, the 2015 hit, ‘Daddy’s Home’, Brad Whittaker (Will Ferrell) and Dusty Mayron (Mark Wahlberg) have finally agreed on a ‘co-dad parenting system’ in this sequel. This comprises jointly spending time with the kids — Megan and Dylan — who are Dusty’s biological children but live with their mother Sara (Linda Cardellini) and their stepdad, Brad. Dusty, who is now married to Karen (Alexandra Ambrosio), has become a stepfather himself to her daughter Adrianna. The complicated family tree becomes further entangled when Brad’s and Dusty’s fathers — Don (John Lithgow and Grandpa Kurt (Mel Gibson) respectively — decide to visit the families for Christmas. Just as we’re getting our minds around the many characters, Kurt decides to rent out a charming cabin in the woods so that everyone can spend the holidays together. <br>As the story moves ahead though, we realise that he has an agenda for doing so. What ensues are a range of amusing incidents that put Brad in bad light in front of the family. With a talented ensemble cast that comprises acting powerhouses such as Ferrell, Wahlberg, Gibson and Lithgow, you know you’re in for a treat. While some of the gags seem predictable, you nonetheless find yourself laughing at the scenarios as clumsy Brad tries his best to bring everyone together. <br>Among the performances, all the lead actors show us just why they’re big names in Hollywood — Gibson, especially, stands out for his superb portrayal as the sarcastic, womanising senior dad, gleefully enjoying Brad’s repeated misfortune. Although Ferrell and Lithgow seem a tad over-the-top, they do their parts well. Director Sean Anders does a decent job of giving everyone a fair share of screen time although we do wish Gibson had even more screen space, given his comic timing. Some characters aren’t fleshed out well — there is zilch interaction between the characters of Dusty and Karen, who seem more like acquaintances than husband and wife. On the whole, ‘Daddy’s Home 2’ is a fun Xmas outing that you can enjoy with the whole family. Happy holidays! <br>","3.5"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> In a typical, suburban American town where nothing seems to happen, a home invasion sparks of a chain of events that may change the town forever.<br><br><strong>Review: </strong>Suburbicon is as all-white as a town in the 50s America could be. Perfectly manicured lawns, identical looking homes and a place where nothing spectacular ever happens. It’s a place described very well in Pete Seeger’s song folk song ‘Little Boxes’. Gardner Lodge (Matt Damon) almost personifies the town’s character. Clean-cut and subdued, he works a mid-level job and lives with his wife Rose, her twin sister Margret (Julianne Moore) and his little son Nicky (Noah Jupe). Two things happen that suddenly start exposing the ugly side of Suburbicon. The first is when a black family arrives in town and you get to see the blatant racism and hate shown to them by the sweet, townsfolk. The second is when two robbers break into Gardner’s home and kill his wife Rose by overdosing her with chloroform. With these two plots running parallel, filmmaker George Clooney along with fellow writers, the Coen brothers, takes the viewers on a journey into the psyche of suburban America. As racial tensions heat up around the town, with the townsfolk inciting a riot around the black family’s house, Gardner’s life spins out of control given that he, too, harbours a dark secret.<br><br>One can see the mark of Coen brothers all through the film. Be it the set, the design, or even with the characters; you get that familiar, 'Fargo' vibe, which is a good thing. Production is top notch and the 50s are bought to life perfectly. The film’s biggest strength though is the acting by the entire cast. Young Noah Jupe as Nicky Gardner delivers a nuanced performance as a kid who has just lost his mother and is coming to terms with the world around him. Matt Damon, too, is fantastic and delivers a measured performance as a man slowly going to bits. Oscar Isaac as the swarthy insurance agent is darkly funny, as he corners the family and derives sadistic pleasure in doing that. Music by Alexandre Desplat adds brilliantly to the tension in scenes.<br><br>With the terrific potential the script has, the climax feels very easy and drawn out. A film with a wonderfully complex first half deserves a second one that matches. The banal simplicity is what is off-putting. Still, 'Suburbicon' is worth a watch for the spectacular performances.<br><br>","3.5"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>The Foreigner Story:</strong> When a lonely, timid Chinese businessman loses his daughter in a London bomb blast, he goes all out to find who killed his daughter and ruined his world. His quest has him take on the highest authorities, no matter what the cost.<br> <strong><br>The Foreigner Review: </strong>We are used to seeing Jackie Chan as a quick-footed, glib-tongued Kung Fu master in movies. His mix of funny, stylised and over the top fight sequences has been the USP of his films. The Foreigner, that way, is quite different. Here you don’t get to see Jackie fight all out. In this one, he acts. As Quan, Jackie is portrayed as a loner whose only joy in life is his daughter Fan (Katie Leung). When he loses her to a ghastly bomb blast, blamed on an extreme faction of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), Quan goes into the deep end of a murky world of mercenaries, revolutionaries and politicians to avenge his little one’s death; chief among them being the Irish Politician Liam Hennessey (Pierce Brosnan).<br>At almost two hours, it may get a little overwhelming to see a little Asian man, park out in the woods and plan revenge against his daughter’s killers without any real fight. But the way that Casino Royale filmmaker Martin Campbell has chalked Quan’s character and the methods he uses, can keep you engrossed. Jackie Chan may not be the best actor out there, but he manages to deliver the goods on this one. Pierce Brosnan plays his part as a mercenary-turned- politician to the T. <br><br>The fact that IRA is not the most threatening terror outfit may make this film seem out of the place when placed in context with our current terrorism scenarios. Yet give it a chance. Go along with Jackie with this ride. He may not come out as a super hero always, in every scene, but its heartening to watch him try. <br><br>","3.5"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Things go awfully wrong rather quickly when a single mother moves into a haunted house with her three children. <br><br><strong>Review: </strong>When Joan Walker (Jennifer Jason Leigh) moves into the reportedly haunted Amityville House with her three kids — Belle (Bella Thorne), Juliet (Mckenna Grace) and James (Cameron Monaghan), the family is hoping for a fresh start. Having fallen on difficult times after James is left brain-dead following an unfortunate accident, Joan is struggling to pay for his rising healthcare costs while hoping he gets better someday. Soon after trying to settle into a new school where Belle struggles to make friends, she starts experiencing strange things around the house. She discovers that 40 years ago, a family had been murdered by one of their own members in the very house she now resides in. Belle increasingly gets convinced that tragic incident is behind the uneasiness and sense of foreboding she feels.<br><br>While director Franck Khalfoun tries his best to salvage a weak script, he depends far too much on trying to startle the viewer with clichéd eerie scenarios that include slamming doors and windows, and dream sequences that seem repetitive after some time. The simmering tension between Joan and Belle over James’ well-being seems illogical given the fact that the former is hoping for a miracle cure despite knowing he has been possessed. The story fails to mask the weak attempt at trying to scare the audience and you find yourself asking several questions about the characters who almost seem indifferent to the proceedings. <br><br>Among the performances, Thorne does a somewhat decent job as the distressed sister while as the comatose James, Monaghan tries his best to deliver a role that has many limitations. The rest of the cast fail to leave an impact and the film doesn’t quite engage you after a while. While Hollywood is known for its spook fests, not all of them manage to creep the heebie jeebies out of you. Although Amityville: The Awakening has instances where you might get a start, the film doesn’t quite succeed in its mission of being a bonafide horror flick where you literally jump out of your skin. Horror fans can probably give it a single viewing but if you aren’t a fan of the genre, you could skip this one. <br><br>","2.5"

Kiril's brother murders the gangster's son who hides the diamonds in the toilet of the strip club.

Now the gangster, is out to avenge his son's murder, the strip club owner wants his diamonds back and Lonnie and Brian get involved in this dangerous game.<br><br>This South African production helmed by director Maynard Kraak is an amateurish attempt at tickling the funny bone. While it was intended to be a situational comedy, the gags seem laboured and the innumerable twists and turns seem forced. Comedian Dalin Oliver tries to elicit laughs with his act as a janitor who is easily bullied and is not taken seriously but his efforts don't always hit the right chord. While the makers have tried to milk the script which revolves around a watch for laughs, as a viewer you will be only keeping a close look at your watch and pray that this hair-brained comedy will be over soon.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Wonder Story: </strong>Based on the New York Times bestseller, Wonder tells the incredibly inspiring and heart-warming story of August ‘Auggie’ Pullman.<br> <br><strong>Wonder Review:</strong> Wonder features the unusual pairing of Owen Wilson and Julia Roberts as Nate and Isabel Pullman - the parents of Auggie (Jacob Tremblay) who was born with facial congenital deformities. Being home-schooled, he has avoided showing his face in public for most of his life but that's about to change for the 10-year-old, now that his parents decide to send him to middle school. Auggie faces ridicule, bullying and discovers the ups and downs of friendship as he comes to terms with his condition. What's interesting is how 'Wonder' takes this story about the little boy and weaves it around his parents, his teenaged sister Via, and all the school kids he encounters.<br><br>This is backed by strong performances behind the major characters, with Jacob Tremblay being really effective as Auggie. His personality shines through as an intelligent boy lacking in confidence, and this allows us to be emotionally invested in how he changes over the course of the film. Izabela Vidovic as Via captures the woes of a teen dealing with isolation because of her family's need to focus on her brother. Owen Wilson puts in an honest turn as the sweet and sensitive paternal figure and is well-placed opposite Julia Roberts who delivers one of her best performances in years as a mother who has to juggle with everyone’s feelings in the Pullman household.<br> <br>There are some clichéd postcard-worthy quotes in ‘Wonder’ but they still manage to land home without cheating their way into pulling at your heartstrings. The film avoids the manipulative methods usually employed by Hollywood tearjerkers by giving us some perspective on the lives of those closest to Auggie, and how they are affected by his condition. Co-writer & Director Stephen Chbosky takes a lot of care to portray scenarios that are largely realistic, and witty enough to pardon some of the mandatory sugar-coating a premise like this would warrant. There are points when you will reach out for some tissues but they’re peppered with enough laughs along the way to make it well-balanced, extremely relevant and combined with a strong message. This wholesome family entertainer is certainly worth your time!<br>","4"

Strangers being stranded on a stalled train makes for a great premise, given the thrill of finding a killer lurking around.<br><br>However, this dangerous train ride has its own delays if not derailment. Kenneth Branagh who plays the most crucial character of Poirot and directs the film as well, looks like he is trying to bite off more than he can chew.<br><br>While he manages to infuse the necessary underlying tension, awkwardness and silence between his characters, he and his dramatic moustache and accent struggle to make this retelling of 1930s whodunit, appeal to the contemporary audience. To set an entire movie in just one frame (train compartment) and yet make it look engaging is another challenge. Branagh wins some, loses some.<br><br>We particularly liked how he captures his characters as they steal a glance at each other. You wish the story played around their unspoken emotions a little more before diving straight into the investigation. Character buildup seems hurried and thus ineffective.<br><br>Speaking of Poirot and his obsession for ‘balance’, only if Branagh had maintained that as a director as well. Barring Michelle Pfeiffer and Branagh himself, most talented actors like Judi Dench and Penelope Cruz get lost in the crowd.<br><br>Overall, despite the glitches and avalanches, thanks to a stellar cast and gripping source material, this mysterious train journey is worth taking.

"<div class='Normal'><p><strong>Coco Story:</strong> A multi-generational story by Disney-Pixar about the power of family relationships.</p><p><strong>Coco Review:</strong> Disney-Pixar has repeatedly raised the bar of animated movies by telling stories that would appeal to children and adults alike. But their past couple of films seemed to miss that crucial element of storytelling, leading to some sub-par entries in their otherwise impressive catalogue. ‘Coco’ is an original tale, and a highly imaginative one at that, by writer/ co-director Adrian Molina. Based in Mexico, it introduces us to the Rivera family who makes shoes for a living and everyone absolutely despises anything related to music. Except for little Miguel Rivera, who shines shoes but aspires to be a musician. Through the course of the film, Miguel enters the Land of the Dead and learns the truth about who his family really is.</p><p>‘Coco’ is colorful and vibrant, blending a number of unique personalities and vivid landscapes. Director Lee Unkrich keeps the narrative taut; throwing in a couple of twists along with some truly powerful moments that will invariably pull at your heartstrings. The voice acting from an all-Latino cast is top-notch, with Anthony Gonzalez’s Miguel being endearing. Gael García Bernal & Benjamin Bratt who play Héctor and Ernesto de la Cruz respectively make each character unique. Renée Victor as the wisecracking, feisty Abuelita is a treat. Even Dante, Miguel’s pet street dog who doesn’t have any lines, is adorable and plays a vital role too.</p><p>Going beyond the usual ‘follow your dreams’ mantra, ‘Coco’ has multiple messages to take home. It’s also a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of being a celebrity, and more importantly an ode to family, especially the ones who aren’t with us anymore. Even though it’s primarily set in Mexico and steeped in their culture, anyone who values family, and music, will connect with it immediately. Expect guitar sales to spike as musically-inclined kids will be inspired to take up lessons. The fact that even some adults might be tempted to do the same, is a testament to why this film works so well. ‘Coco’ shows us what Disney-Pixar does best, and reminds us that it still hasn’t lost its touch. Take your kids along for it, and if you don’t have any, don’t hesitate to go alone!</p><p><em>Disney-Pixar Shorts’ ‘Olaf’s Frozen Adventure’ (21.51 mins) will play before this feature.

"<div class='Normal'> A gritty tale about war veterans trying to adjust to life as civilians<br><br><strong>Story:</strong> Inspired by a true story, the film follows a group of US war veterans after they return from their long stint in Iraq and the struggles they face as they try to adjust to life back home while dealing with painful memories that refuse to go away. <br><br><strong>Review: </strong>There have been a number of films that focus on war veterans and the trying times they face once they return home from the war, and Thank You For Your Service doesn’t quite go off the beaten track. The film begins with Staff Sergeant Adam Schumann (Miles Teller) going back home after 15 months to his wife Saskia (Haley Bennett) and their two young children. His absence from home has resulted in the kids viewing their father more like a stranger since he has missed a chunk of their childhood while fighting battles in war-torn Iraq. Although happy to be back with his family amidst familiar surroundings, Adam struggles to get back to normalcy thanks to the fact that he is suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) that causes terrifying flashbacks and difficulty adjusting to domestic life. As Saskia goes through her own torment of watching her husband deteriorate in front of her eyes, she convinces him to get help at the Department of Veterans Affairs, which is already overwhelmed with physically and mentally stunted soldiers. Adam finds comfort in two fellow soldiers — Solo Aeiti (Beulah Koale) and Billy Waller (Joe Cole) who are battling their own demons after returning home from the horrors of war. <br><br>With a fairly talented cast, Thank You For Your Service deftly showcases the emotional trauma that soldiers go through during combat, and more importantly, after it. From the performances, Teller and Koale stand out, as the remorseful soldiers who are struggling to come to terms with traumatic events. The rest of the supporting cast ably showcase the lives of war veterans and their families without going over the top. <br><br>The range of emotions — from anger and guilt to fear and redemption — is subtly captured by director Jason Hall. You do feel sorry for the characters as they try to manoeuvre through a web of emotions. Unfortunately, although the film engages you in the beginning, the pace tends to slow down towards the end. While war films aren’t always everyone’s cup of tea, thanks to their (usually) dramatic storyline, this one’s worth a watch if you’re in the mood for something serious. <br>","3.5"

Sure, the build-up has been shaky along the way, but fans of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) saw a distinct glimmer of hope with ‘Wonder Woman’ earlier this year. It seemed like some crucial lessons had been learned, albeit the hard way, and set into motion. But production woes dogged ‘Justice League’, striking fear in the hearts of fans – would this be another major misstep from the DC stable?</p>Let’s get to the good stuff first – this is definitely a highly enjoyable comic book film! Even though the marketing desperately tried to showcase its difference in tone from the rest of the DCEU, most of the chuckle & gasp-worthy scenes land home on the big screen despite being devoid of the surprise element. We’re familiar enough with the big three – Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman, so Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, and Henry Cavill are all allowed to shine through and make their presence felt. Even the relatively new additions – Aquaman, Flash, and Cyborg, fit well into this world and the actors are well-cast. Thankfully, the whole team has ample chemistry with each other, and while the story is derivative with a disposable villain, it focuses on quickly dazzling from one scene to the next.<br><br>Sadly, it’s also hard to look past the production issues because they are quite evident at some points. Some chunks seem to be missing from the story, and although it doesn’t come across as incoherent, it feels tremendously rushed along with evidently last-minute CGI patchwork. Clearly, the DCEU is building towards bigger, and hopefully better things, but the course-correction feel is glaringly obvious. That aside, it commits to a distinct goosebump-inducing, fandom-pleasing tonality, one that will be well-appreciated down the line. Replace your skeptical lens with 3D glasses, and cheer along with your childhood heroes; ‘Justice League’ is made for the fans, and if you’re one, you’ll have a lot of fun.","3.5"

But what is it about Christmas that compels Hollywood to churn out lazy comedies? It requires some amount of absurd reasoning, or in this case – foreign financing, to take an average film – 2016’s ‘Bad Moms’, and give it a sequel with a holiday theme, no less.</p><p>Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell & Kathryn Hahn are back to showcase their best bad behaviour. This time they’re joined by their mothers played by Susan Sarandon, Christine <span class='itemprop'>Baranski and Cheryl Hines. While one is extremely carefree, another is over-possessive and there’s a perfectionist thrown in for good measure. All to ensure that the mother lode of stereotypical, dysfunctional maternal figures can be mined for a laugh. Naturally, this allows for a wide range of jokes at their expense, but when the writers chose to infuse every other sentence with an expletive, you know they’re aiming for low-hanging fruit. While the film seems to be aimed at the female demographic, it’s written by the two men who penned ‘The Hangover’. That isn’t essentially a problem in itself, although it’s another matter when you hear a little girl dropping F-bombs. It’s one of the rarest cases where you might just be thankful for our conservative censor board! The film feels like it’s grabbing every opportunity to justify the ‘bad’ in the title, with ample genital anatomy gags and crude sexual innuendo.</span></p><p>The less said about the performances, the better. The three main leads seem to be going through the motions with barely any investment into their characters. The actresses playing their mothers, however, display a little more experience. Susan Sarandon seems to have signed up for this movie just to let her hair loose and have some fun with an edgy character prone to debauchery. Yet even the Academy Award winner doesn’t do much to justify her presence. This is indicative of the film as a whole – sure there are a few occasional laughs, even if they’re incredibly silly. Sadly, the film holds back from completely committing to that direction and ends up being yet another generic Christmas flick. Watch this only if you’ve exhausted all the other choices out there.</p>","2.5"

The film loses momentum as Armand embarks on his journey of self-discovery amidst trying to unveil the real reason behind the apparent suicide. Jumping back and forth in time during various phases of Van Gogh’s life, the broad brushstrokes eventually begin to give some insights into his troubled psyche.</p><p>Sadly, the plot isn’t as taut as it should be, and the air of mystery isn’t as compelling as the imagery used to paint the whole picture. This is undoubtedly a tall order, and should not dissuade viewers from the visual indulgence. Aided by a fine score courtesy Clint Mansell, your patience will be rewarded as long as you focus on the presentation beyond the slow pacing and all the conjecture. That itself is worth the price of admission for what will remain a significant cinematic achievement.</p>","3.5"
"<div class='Normal'><p><strong>Story:</strong> A world-wide net of interconnected satellites installed to save the planet from storms fails and starts attacking the world instead and humanity has precious few hours left to save itself from the storm of biblical proportions.<br class='m_-6300895552345802025gmail-kix-line-break'><br><strong>Review:</strong> America saves the world again! Only this time, the problem was created by the US in coalition with several other nations. So, it’s more a clean-up job really, headed by the angry satellite designer, Jake Lawson. In his zeal to save a hurricane from hitting China Jake uses unauthorised access to ‘Dutchboy’, a web of satellites which alters the weather on earth. For this, he is dismissed and replaced by his younger brother Max. But now, as ‘Dutchboy’ goes berserk and starts to malfunction attacking cities all over the world, Jake is called back and shot 250 miles up into space to fix the problem. He finds that this is no malfunction. Someone is wrecking the thing he created and he needs to fix it before the unknown entity can create the mother of all storms — the ‘Geostorm’.</p><p>This is your typical disaster movie. It’s a shame though, that five years after the film ‘2012’, Hollywood has not learned much. The only good thing about it is the 4D. So when there is a car chase or a rocket shoots into space, you feel your seat vibrating. If there is lightning on screen, white halogens in the theatre flicker. And if there is a storm, cold water is sprayed on your face with giant blowers. But that gets boring after a while and is quite unpleasant if you are watching the early morning first show!</p><p>The climax is atypical and the performances are strictly okay. Gerard Butler is dependable as an actor but doesn’t really bring anything to the table with his acting. Same is the case with Jim Sturgess as his younger brother. Ed Harris as the U.S. Secretary of State Leonard and Andy Garcia as the President are both wasted, given the talent they possess. The biggest irony is that the big ‘Geostorm’ that everyone is so afraid of doesn’t really happen. However, the 4D vibrations and halogen-flickers kind of make-up for it.</p><p>It’s only entertaining when you watch it in 4D. Because on a normal screen, it’s just another one of those movies where there is so much destruction and so little story, you literally stop caring whether the world ends or not. Although you definitely want what’s playing on the screen to end!</p>","3"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Thor: Ragnarok Story</strong>:  The mighty Thor finds himself imprisoned on the other side of the universe, in a race against time to prevent the all-powerful Hela from destroying his homeworld of<span class='_dgc'> Asgard. His quest for survival leads him into a deadly gladiatorial contest that pits him against the Hulk.</span><br><br><strong>Thor: Ragnarok Review</strong>: From the very first look at Marvel’s latest outing, it became apparent that there was something unique about ‘Thor: Ragnarok’. More vibrant than its two prequels, and combined with a quirky sense of humour, it reunites us with two larger-than-life superheroes – Thor and the Hulk, both of whom we haven’t seen since ‘Avengers: Age of Ultron’ in 2015. From the outset, it’s evident how well these two play with, and against each other, continuing their love-hate bromance established in the first ‘Avengers’ film. Additionally, the film is infused with Taika Waititi’s trademark style of oddball comedy and while he plays wonderfully within Marvel’s sandbox, his imprint is evident in every frame and dialogue. Additionally, it translates very well on screen in all the performances from the ensemble cast.<br><br>Considering that the odds are stacked against him, Thor is challenged in a way that brings a whole new side to the God of Thunder. A re-energized Chris Hemsworth gets to flex his comedic muscles to full effect. Naturally, this rubs off well on the Hulk as well, especially since Mark Ruffalo is completely at home playing the angry green man-child. The scenes between him and Thor are captivating to watch and will leave you wanting more. Tom Hiddleston is up to his usual charming mischief as Loki but hands over scene-stealing duties to newcomer Tessa Thompson. She proves to be an essential addition, with a spirited performance as the feisty Valkyrie. Two veteran actors who fit right into the proceedings while clearly having a blast are Jeff Goldblum and Cate Blanchett. The latter’s Hela particularly stands out with a delightfully devious role as Marvel’s first female villain onscreen.<br><br>Considering that Marvel’s next big film is ‘Avengers: Infinity War’ which will undoubtedly feature an unprecedented number of superheroes sharing screen space and time, the plot here does feel somewhat rushed as the wheels are in motion for the next big entry. The stakes are far from low, but the film’s overall impact on the MCU is debatable. But that doesn’t take away from the fact that this feels like a zany comic book brought to life. It’s an insanely fun ride from start to finish – one that you’d want to hop right back on for another round; not unlike a Led Zeppelin track on loop. Clearly, third time is a charm for Thor as ‘Ragnarok’ is the best film on the Asgardian till date, and another entry from Marvel you simply cannot miss!<br><br>","4.0"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Victoria & Abdul Story:</strong> In her latter years, Victoria, the Queen of England and Empress of India (Judi Dench), found solace in the company of an Indian clerk Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal), who went on to become her Urdu teacher, spiritual adviser and closest confidant. Based on Shrabani Basu’s book on this extraordinary true story, the film takes a bittersweet look at this little-known friendship that caused a furore within the royal household.<br><br><strong>Victoria & Abdul Review:</strong> Stephen Frears begins his film by taking us through the monotonous routine of Queen Victoria as she goes around meeting her social obligations during her Golden Jubilee year (1887). During one such royal gatherings, she glances upon Abdul, a wide-eyed Indian boy, who presents her the ceremonial coin (mohur). Despite being warned against looking at her, Abdul’s childish intrigue makes him stare back at her and flash a nervous smile when their eyes meet, amidst a sea of exasperated privileged people. Abdul’s accidental defiance and indifference to protocol, liberates the queen emotionally, who is a prisoner by her own means. Evidently, a ‘Hindoo’ attendant’s rising influence on the queen, rattles members and servants of the royal family, who later discover that he’s Muslim.<br><br>At 82, Judi Dench arrests your attention with her unwavering screen presence and eyes that exude a myriad of emotions – mischief, melancholy, loneliness and longing. She humanises her character effortlessly. Your heart goes out to the ageing monarch as she engages in introspection on a quiet, windy day and tells Abdul, “Everyone I’ve loved has died, and I just go on and on.” Dench is the reason why this fascinating story refuses to seem like a ‘scandal’.<br><br>Making the most of this incredible opportunity, Ali Fazal holds his own in front of a legend (Dench). Frears smartly uses Ali’s raw, nervous energy and enthusiasm and infuses it in Abdul, organically. However, his one-dimensional portrayal of the munshi, leaves a lot to imagination and thus unexplained. Why was an Indian so devoted to the Queen of England, who ruled his country? (He even happily kisses her feet). Was he naïve or just an opportunist? What was he like as a person? The narrative reduces Abdul to being a mere spectator and that’s its biggest flaw. Also, the film falters as it abruptly changes gear and transforms into a tedious tragedy from a cross-cultural comedy.<br><br>Despite an uneven narrative and historical inaccuracies, Victoria and Abdul is a delightful film that deserves to be watched for Judi Dench.<br><br>","3.5"

But there’s a catch. Lloyd (Dave Franco), the leader of the pack aka Green Ninja happens to be the son of Garmadon and nephew of Wu. Torn between the angst against his absentee father and admiration for his spiritual uncle, he becomes the binding force that bridges the gap between good and evil.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong> First things first. You don’t have to watch the first two Lego movies or read up on the video games or the toys to get this one. The Ninjago is a delightful animation film that rides on wry humour and caters to all age groups, of course, mostly children.</p><p>Keeping with the Lego movie tradition, it takes a satirical look at superhero films (like the ‘Power Rangers’ series) and their penchant for revolving around cheesy family dramas. The film spoofs the genre smartly, unlike its counterparts that strive to offer cutesy entertainment. This isn’t a piece of typical animation fluff and that is its biggest USP, along with some real good voice-overs, a monstrous cat and nuanced creation of the city of Ninjago.</p><p>Humour holds the film together and it’s fascinating to see it stem from mocking our perception of ‘ideal’ relationships – be it between father-son, best friends/outcasts, or teacher-student. You chuckle when Lloyd’s friend tries to comfort him by saying, “It’s okay. Parents are weird. My mother collects seashells, your father levels cities and kills innocent people.” A tantric flute music deliberately plays in the background, marking the arrival of master Wu, who teaches martial arts to the millennial ninjas, which is ‘totes’ (read totally) hilarious.</p><p>Overall, the film is a joy ride as it boasts of an adorable father-son quirky banter and the ninja adventures.

How that showdown turns out is what the movie is all about.<br> <br>What’s evident at the start is that the film doesn’t focus on Bruce Lee as it should. It instead focuses more on Steve’s character as a wandering sixties flower child and his love interest Xiulan (Qu Jingjing) who is being groomed to work at a brothel. Fans of Lee would of course want to see their icon recreated and actually fight. But that is not what makes up the film. Majorly, everything works to make possible the epic showdown between Man and Lee. However, they payback in that scene ends up disappointing you.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> American Made brings the chilling true story of the infamous Barry Seal to the big screen, seen through his eyes. Seal was an American airline pilot who operated as CIA’s (Central Intelligence Agency) spy, drug smuggler for the Medellín Cartel (led by drug lord Pablo Escobar) and informant for the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) and the White House, before he was murdered in 1986 by Escobar’s contract killers. Tom Cruise essays the role of Barry Seal.<br><br><strong>Review:</strong> Director Doug Liman’s tragicomedy takes a unique and playful look at Seal’s dangerous but fascinating under the table dealings with the CIA and drug cartels in the 70s and 80s. How he led a double life and smoothly juggled the various nefarious activities forms the story. Interestingly, he was well aware that he is merely a puppet of the American government and a pawn in the grand scheme of things. Nonetheless, he chose to make hay while the sun shines.<br><br>While the subject itself evokes intrigue, credit must go to Liman for giving that satirical twist to an otherwise intense crime thriller. However, given the subject at hand and its socio-political undertones, it’s impossible to capture it all in a film that runs for a little less than two hours. What you thus get is a hurried recap of Seal’s antics. You hope to explore how Seal covered his tracks but that isn’t substantially explained.<br><br>What then keeps you hooked despite the shortcomings is Tom Cruise’s classic charm (trademark aviators, et al) coupled with some clever humour. Just like Seal, Cruise manages to ‘deliver’. In a career spanning over three decades, the quintessential movie star proves his mettle as an actor once again as he essays Seal’s naïve recklessness, moral ambiguity and hide and seek with danger, in an earnest manner. Given Cruise’s penchant for being drawn to commercially viable entertainers that reduced him to ‘running in the movies since 1981’ (as his Twitter bio rightly says); American Made comes as a breath of fresh air.<br><br>This is a fascinating story told in a fascinating way. Much recommended for those who crave to see Tom Cruise in films beyond the formulaic but entertaining Mission Impossible series, forgettable Jack Reacher installments and that awful Mummy reboot.<br><br>","3.5"

"<div class='Normal'><p>Story: Mitch Rapp, is recovering from a terrorist attack when he is recruited into a covert Black Ops team under CIA figure Stan Hurley. Rapp and Hurley are then dispatched on a mission to stop a mysterious rogue operative from unleashing chaos of international proportions.</p><p>Review: ‘American Assassin’ is guilty of laying down the foundation for yet another potential franchise from start to finish. Mitch Rapp (Dylan O’Brien) seems to be a happy-go-lucky guy who suffers a personal loss that changes him into a man in urgent need of anger management. It’s a familiar origin story firmly rooted in vengeance – one that comes in the form of a recruitment opportunity with a covert Black Ops team, one that obviously ‘does not exist’, and it also acts as an excuse for blatant American jingoism – as evident in the title itself. The usual hijinks ensue – exceptionally gifted but troubled operatives encounter double-crossing, rogue agents leading to location-hopping and nuclear bombs; all these and other staples are gratuitously ticked off the list and at the end of it all, you’d be left wondering how it escalated so quickly.</p><p>Then again, what ‘American Assassin’ lacks in originality, it makes up in breathtaking action that is often brutal. It’s the film’s saving grace because of how it springs up on you unexpectedly. Some of this is hidden under clunky editing but there are ample sequences that go by without letting you off the hook. Additionally, the cast is reasonably invested in their performances which certainly doesn’t hurt. Although, the one character who stands out is Michael Keaton’s Stan Hurley. There’s nothing new about the ‘tough love’ mentor he plays, but at least he embraces it in all earnest. If nothing else, it solidifies his resurgence as a reliably watchable actor.</p><p>It has become difficult for the spy/ assassin film genre to differentiate one entry from the other. In many ways, they all come across as clones following some minor variation of the same generic plot points. ‘American Assassin’ is no different from what we’ve seen before in the likes of ‘John Wick’ and ‘Jason Bourne’, but at least it’s captivating enough to keep you entertained throughout its runtime. You’d probably suffer from a serious case of deja vu through it, but if you need a fix of nail-biting action, you’ll definitely get your money’s worth.</p>","3.5"
"<div class='Normal'><hr><p><strong>Story: </strong>Two humanoid cyborgs travel back in time to battle each other over John Connor – the leader of the human resistance in a futuristic war against Artificial Intelligence.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong> In 1984, writer-director James Cameron created an iconic entity in the ‘Terminator’ – a heartless and relentless cyborg that looked human but only on the outside. The Terminator could not be stopped or reasoned with; he would destroy everything in his path till he completed his singular mission. If there was ever an actor best suited to play a robotic, expressionless, and intimidating machine, who better than Arnold Schwarzenegger? Building on his status as an action superstar, Cameron capitalized on this genius casting by flipping the horrific antagonist into a protective warrior in the 1991 sequel. Cameron also pushed the boundaries of the visual effects industry at that point, by establishing standards that are still being followed till today. What’s truly astounding is how they have managed to still look new and fresh in this remastered version.</p><p>However, none of that would matter in the absence of a thrilling story that picked up where the prequel left off and took the franchise to a whole new direction. Cameron built on what worked the first time around and added crucial emotional beats here as well.  There’s a strong sense of family between the T-800 (Schwarzenegger) and the Connors (Linda Hamilton & Edward Furlong), even when they’re all flawed in their own unique ways. This bond is what pushes them to confront the adversity they encounter in the form of the advanced liquid metal cyborg, played so despicably by Robert Patrick. His menacing, shape-shifting T-1000 is the perfect foil to Schwarzenegger’s bulking juggernaut. Sparks literally fly when they collide, and it’s a thrilling sight, especially in 3D. Modern superhero films can still learn a few things from this action classic.</p><p>‘T2’ truly stands the test of time with a great story combined with smart, and efficient special effects that complement the narrative. After all, the threat of global nuclear annihilation is extremely relevant today, while artificial intelligence sits on the verge of autonomous sentience. This film raised the bar extremely high for action blockbusters and would become a game-changer in the industry – even if the ‘Terminator’ franchise would go on to crumble under heavy expectations. Though you might have watched it repeatedly on cable TV, you simply do not want to miss the surreal and futuristic experience of ‘T2’ on the big screen, remastered in 3D!</p>","4.5"

Can the fluffy gang survive?</p><p><strong>Review:</strong> This survival tale has its share of cute moments and inspiring life lessons but it strictly caters to the younger audience. At a time when most Hollywood animation studios are making films that appeal to all age groups, this one seems a tad dated in terms of its narrative approach and presentation.</p><p>‘There is no substitute for hard work’ is the point that the makers strive to drive home.

If the mayor wasn’t evil enough, you have his destructive, control freak daughter, who sneers at everything that moves. Their collective hatred and attack on the animals seem uncalled for beyond a point.</p><p>Also, the film fails to offer a spectacular visual experience, which could have probably enhanced an enormously cliched and predictable plot.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> In the small town of Derry, Maine, a group of kids dubbed 'The Losers' Club' encounters a shape-shifting demonic entity, known to return every 27 years to prey on fear.<br><br><strong>Review:</strong> Stephen King is one of the most prolific authors in existence today, having written best-selling novels in the horror, supernatural fiction, and fantasy genres. Many of his books have been adapted into films and TV series with varying degrees of success. His works have been notoriously difficult to translate to the screen. This was evident with the previous adaptation of 'It' as a television mini-series in 1990, which was able to capture certain aspects of the novel but failed to be as disturbing. 27 years later, (oddly enough, a period of time significant to the plot of the story itself) Hollywood has decided to revisit this horror classic. <br><br>What this version does extremely well is that it captures the essence of youth. Considering that the story is based entirely on them – each of the young actors tasked with heavy dramatic, and even comedic acting are skilled enough. They portray kids on the verge of puberty, with an extremely relatable camaraderie and it really wouldn't be as effective if there wasn’t the palpable chemistry between the actors. To top that, they all are endearing in their own unique ways, which makes it all the more gut-wrenching when they go up against the monster. A horror film is only as good as the antagonist. Let’s just say that it wouldn't be much of a surprise if Pennywise invokes Coulrophobia – the fear of clowns – in a whole new generation.<br>This balance could not be maintained without a strong screenplay, paired with some taut direction courtesy of Andy Muschietti. Both these components have been put together with a great understanding of the emotional beats behind the source material. Some interesting camerawork and slick editing make this an even potent mix. If there’s one minor misstep, it’s in the background score that tends to get slightly overpowering at times. It makes some of the jump scares slightly predictable to experienced horror fans; although there are others that still manage to catch you by surprise, so it’s pardonable. What works in the film’s favour is that it acts not only as a strong entry by itself but also as a build-up to the inevitable and now essential sequel. Rest assured – King’s nightmare is alive, freaky and endearing at the same time. If you’re a horror fan, don’t miss ‘It’!<br>","4"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Steven Soderbergh’s ‘Logan Lucky’ is an American heist comedy film. It focuses on three siblings who plan to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina.<br><br><strong>Review:</strong> Steven Soderbergh retired from filmmaking in 2013, claiming that he had lost interest in the industry. The director behind the 'Ocean's Trilogy' – the iconic heist series – decided to come out of retirement and make another entry in the same genre, but this time at the other end of the glamor spectrum. If the sophisticated crew of Ocean's had swag, then this ragtag group has rustic charm, and loads of it. Set in West Virginia, there's nothing fancy about any of them, or their methods. But Soderbergh's years of experience with handling an assorted cast hasn't wasted away over the years. He empowers each actor with enough material to showcase their range of skills and to a large extent, they do not disappoint. <br> <br>Tatum & Driver play two siblings carrying some family baggage due to unfortunate events. They both imbibe their characters with a subtle sibling tension under the surface but are undeniably brothers in arms. Their sister Mellie Logan, played by Riley Keough, is a strong presence even with her limited screen time. There are a lot of smaller parts featuring a talented set of actors like Hilary Swank and Seth MacFarlane who might make you wonder what they’re doing in this film at certain points, but clearly, everyone’s having a great time playing this assorted bunch of endearing oddities. That’s certainly the case for Daniel Craig, who seems to have taken up this film as a palate cleanser of sorts. Before he wears the bespoke suit again, and gets back all his fancy toys as the spy extraordinaire, he has to make do as a petty criminal with a penchant for crude bombs. Instead, Craig walks a fine line between being a tightly wound manic genius, and an eccentric loose cannon waiting to blow up. It’s a thrill to watch him at work as the wild card.<br> <br>Which is also a way to describe ‘Logan Lucky’ as a film. It’s unpredictable, with some unforeseen twists and turns but with its heart intact. While the last act feels a bit drawn out, especially with the rushed introduction of a particular character, the majority of the film plays out smoothly and there’s hardly a lull in the quirky humor and suspense. Even if it doesn't raise the stakes of the genre, there’s enough potential to turn this funny and smartly written caper into another entertaining Soderbergh franchise.<br><br>","4"

The two must protect the world from Walter's destructive plans.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Dark Tower </strong><strong>Review : </strong>Based on Stephen King's The Dark Tower book series, the film is about the eternal fight between good and evil. Those who protect versus those who destroy. Can life (Roland and Jake) win over death (Walter) or is death the ultimate conqueror? The metaphors are aplenty.<br>
<br>
Though the film is a fantasy, what essentially works for it is the father-son bond between Jake and Roland. Idris Alba's charisma and effortless screen presence lends gravitas to the script and salvages the otherwise predictable plot. Matthew McConaughey makes bad look sexy. Sadly, his contrived and vague character fails to make an impression and ends up as a weak link.<br>
<br>
About the story, you don't have to read the books to understand this one, which works. On the flip side, despite being gripping, it's quite underwhelming. While The Matrix like action and slowmo bullet battles keep you hooked, the story fails to work on a deeper level as motives remain unexplained (perhaps for sequels to follow).<br>

The Dark Tower keeps you engaged but fails to go beyond offering you some generic escapism.","3"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story :</strong> A follow up to the 2006 documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, where former American Vice President Al Gore attempts to make us aware of the rapidly multiplying dangers of the climate-change crisis.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review :</strong> For the Indian audience, the most relevant part of An Inconvenient Sequel is the recorded meeting between Al Gore and Indian minister Piyush Goyal (power, coal, new and renewable energy), in which Gore suggests, nay, pleads with Goyal to strive for 100% renewable energy. Goyal states that India will do it after 150 years, when the per-capita income will be equivalent to America’s and when Indians will have used up as much coal as Americans did before realizing a need for renewable resources.<br>
<br>
The response, whether or not rooted in logic, brings to attention our attitude towards an escalating global crisis. At another juncture, directors Cohen and Shenk focus on Gore's negotiations with India at 2015’s UN Climate Change Conference. This part, treated like an intriguing thriller, is full of high-power deals and clever detours, where Gore emerges the hero, facilitating a mutually beneficial plan for India and the larger global goal.<br>
<br>
An Inconvenient Sequel stays true to its message, and through clips of Gore at his Climate Leadership Training sessions, highlights just how grave the situation is. It is populated with eye-opening statistics and visits to areas most affected by the climate crisis. It lists Kolkata and Mumbai as high-risk cities; travels to Philippines to shine a light on the havoc wrecked by Typhoon Haiyan and goes to Miami, the city most vulnerable to calamities caused by climate change. Gore also includes anomalies like the Republican mayor of a small Texan town opting for solar energy and demonstrates how the long-abandoned DSCOVR Satellite came to be launched.<br>
<br>
Its only lulls lie in the information-heavy bits (which only reiterate previously established facts) and parts where Gore comes off as an alarmist owning to his angry outbursts. But the documentary works wonderfully as a primer for someone totally unaware of the gravity of the issue, and will reinforce the need for swift action for the ones in the know.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> This is a a biography of a princess who is raised in wealth and opulence who loses it all during tough times. Yet she maintains her dignity as things around her change for worse.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> When a biographical film is made by a relative of the subject or if it is endorsed by them, there is often the danger of losing perspective. ‘Yadvi- The Dignified Princess’ is a film that falls in that trap, but that is just one among its several flaws. A period film, about Yadhuvansh Kumari --- daughter of Patiala’s famous King, Maharaja Bhupinder Singh, it is directed by one of the granddaughters of the late princess, Jyoti Singh, who also plays the titular role. The film follows the life of Yadvi, from the time of her birth until her death.<br>
<br>
It starts of with trivia about Bhupinder Singh (Chandrachur Singh), including the fact that he donated the Ranji trophy and was the first man in India to own an aircraft. There’s also the legend about how he used Rolls Royce cars to clear garbage after being snubbed by the car manufacturer. These are the only interesting aspect of the entire movie.<br>
<br>
Yadvi is set to marry a Rajput prince Govind Singh (Rahul Godara). But after her father’s untimely demise, the Rajput king marries of his son to another princess. Still, Yadvi is asked to go to Maihar by her brothers to take her place as his rightful first wife. Here is when the game of one-upwomanship begins between the two young queens. However, Yadvi remains ‘dignified’ through the ordeal. The real trouble starts as a new lady, Giriraj (Nikkitasha Marwaha) enters her husband's life and transforms the ‘good’ prince to an alcoholic.<br>
<br>
According to the filmmakers, the movie tackles the subject of feminism in the 1940s, well before anyone in India was even aware of it. But that’s not evident at all in the film. Being submissive and dignified, even while facing discrimination from your hubby, is hardly feminism!<br>
<br>
The performances by the entire cast, including Chandrachur Singh are unexciting. One scene where a drunken prince admits his love for his mistress to his father, is just two minutes of men shouting at each other. What’s commendable is the fact that even on a low budget, some of the scenes almost work in establishing the era, but that doesn’t help the film on the whole.<br>
<br>
The music by Anuj Garg is the only thing that works well, including the track ‘Rangreza’ sung by Singh who is a revelation. The entire film is about maintaining the legacy of a princess, but a weak execution coupled with lackluster performances and choppy editing make it a dreary watch.","2"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> A hitman scheduled to testify in court is forced to team up with one of the best bodyguards in the business to ensure he makes it to the trial. Both of them need to put their past behind them and work together to stay alive.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> When you have two bonafide wisecracking action stars together on screen, you pretty much know what to expect - fireworks, F-bombs, explosions, more F-bombs, and bullets flying every which way. 'Hitman's Bodyguard' has all the right ingredients for a recipe that's a lot of fun. Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson are well equipped for the characters they play because, in some ways, they're playing variations of themselves. In fact, it feels as if director Patrick Hughes has pretty much allowed them to improvise their scenes together, especially when they're taking pot shots at each other.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Dollmaker Samuel Mullins opens his home to orphaned girls to fill the void created by his deceased daughter. The girls start discovering mysterious things around the house, surrounding Mullins’s toy creation, the first Annabelle doll.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> A good horror movie makes your heart leap out of your chest while simultaneously tugging at your heartstrings. And we’re happy to report that Annabelle: Creation, the fourth installment in The Conjuring franchise, is emotionally potent and downright scary.<br>
<br>
In pre-Barbie America, dollmaker Samuel Mullins (LaPaglia) lives on a ranch with wife Esther (Otto) and daughter Bee (Lee). The Mullins’s happiness is short-lived; they’re desolated by Bee’s sudden death. Twelve years pass, and Samuel decides to turn his empty home into an orphanage for six girls. Even before the girls can settle in and play house, the house starts throwing new horrors at them every night. Best friends Janice (Bateman) and Linda (Wilson) become the first victims of Samuel’s strange-looking locked-away doll, Annabelle.<br>
<br>
The Conjuring movie universe grows inward and outward with prequels and sequels, each one delivering a terrifying new nightmare. The makers stick to old-school tactics of haunted houses, little-girl ghosts and jump-scares, but deliver coherent and effective movies.<br>
<br>
Director David F. Sandberg, a master of anticipatory horror (you must see Lights Out), builds a tense atmosphere even while working with a banal plot. The formula is so plain that you’d think you know the movie, but Sandberg infuses jumps and starts so creatively that it becomes a dangerous game of peek-a-boo. With a huge house and six girls in the forefront, there’s an unmissable The Conjuring vibe; a great reference to the previous (and undoubtedly inferior) Annabelle movie connects the universes perfectly. There are several sub-plots worthy of a spin-off.<br>
<br>
The story of Janice could be especially interesting. Talitha Bateman is a scene-stealer; her cold stares and measured madness make you wary of Janice. As helpless parents, Otto and LaPaglia bring a tenderness to this terror-fest.<br>
<br>
Having watched the previous films will help, but the movie is a legitimate standalone chiller. If there were a Horror For Dummies guidebook, Annabelle: Creation would make for a good chapter in it.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>STORY: </strong>Set in a fantasy world inside the smart phone of a teenager, the film revolves around an emoji called Gene. Unlike his 'meh' parents, he can't stick to expressing just one emotion. Tagged as a 'malfunction' for being multi-expressional, he flees the digital city along with his friends Hi5 and Jailbreak so that he's not 'deleted'.<br>
<br>
<strong>REVIEW: </strong>‘Embrace yourself just the way you are and why fit in when you can stand out?’ is the message that lies at the heart of this digital tale. The thought is sweet but just an idea can't salvage a predictable advertisement parading as a film.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>A lethal assassin fights for her life in Berlin during the Cold War as she uncovers a deadly game of spies.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> We've seen a recent spike in strong female protagonists who can hold their own in battle; films like 'Wonder Woman', 'Ghost in the Shell', 'Valerian' and even 'Logan' come to mind. Charlize Theron made quite an impact as Furiosa in 'Mad Max: Fury Road'. Based on a graphic novel 'The Coldest City',' Atomic Blonde' is cut from the same cloth as 'John Wick' featuring gunplay and close quarters hand-to-hand combat that will make you wince. Keeping all that in mind, it isn't exactly a far stretch to seeing the Oscar-award winning actress as Lorraine Broughton – an MI6 agent who is more than capable of receiving and dishing out a thorough bashing.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story :</strong> Special operatives Valerian and Laureline must race to identify a dark force which threatens Alpha, a vast metropolis and home to species from a thousand planets.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review : </strong>Valerian is a French sci-fi comic book series from the late 60’s that became iconic in European pop culture. It has influenced various science fiction films including the Star Wars series, and Luc Besson's previous films like 'The Fifth Element'. It's obvious that Besson has grown up reading these comics, making this film a passion project. The question is – how does that translate on screen, and more importantly to an international audience who isn't quite familiar with this series?<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>The Black Prince </strong><strong>Story : </strong>Set in the 19th century (India’s pre-independence years), The Black Prince is the agonising true tale of Duleep Singh, the last Sikh king of Punjab, who was robbed off his mother, Kingdom, faith and lineage by the British. Raised as a Christian 'prince' in England by Queen Victoria (Amanda Root), Duleep's yearning to embrace his faith, reclaim his identity and trace his roots, forms the story. The fearless woman who fans and reignites the fire within him to discover who he really is and regain his lost kingdom, freedom and glory, happens to be his mother Rani Jindan (Shabana Azmi). But his struggle to be reunited to his motherland was endless.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Black Prince </strong><strong>Review : </strong>It must not be easy to live with the constant anxiety of not knowing your past too well. One takes great pride in stating the language they speak; the country they belong to or the faith they follow. Take that away and you have nothing that truly belongs to you. The protagonist (Satinder Sartaaj as Duleep Singh) battles a similar situation here. He was stolen from his mother when he was barely five and exiled from his own country. Raised as British, he soon realises that he is actually a prisoner, trapped by the lies and deceit of his enemy.<br>
<br>
Kavi Raz’s film solely rests on Duleep’s longing and liberation. It’s his tragic story that’s heart-breaking more than the snail-paced execution, stoic portrayal by Sartaaj and ineffective writing. The film needed a competent actor in the lead role as the moment you take Shabana Azmi away, it ceases to hold your interest. As a feisty queen, who is appalled by her son’s indifference to his country, she proves for the umpteenth time, why she is one of our finest actors, ever. Amanda Root and Jason Flemyng do a fine job as well.<br>
<br>
Given the period drama’s slow moving pace and melancholic nature, it could have perhaps worked better as a tele-series. An episodic retelling could have been more impactful.<br>
<br>
Despite the story’s massive potential, Raz’s sincere but dimly-lit drama, monotonously shot within the four walls of a church or a heritage room, ends up being a tedious watch. Just like its protagonist, it lacks drive and a sense of purpose.","3"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Dunkirk </strong><strong>Story:</strong> ‘Dunkirk’ is a World War II film by Christopher Nolan which depicts the story of a French beach and harbour where allied soldiers were caught in a fierce battle, with nowhere to escape.<br>
<br>
<strong>Dunkirk </strong><strong>Review: </strong>Christopher Nolan is a director who puts a lot of thought into writing and directing his films. He's a visual storyteller who cares dearly about the narrative structure he painstakingly arranges on the screen while treating his audience with substantial intelligence. For years, he’s broken new ground in cinema by tackling complex concepts with multiple layers that unravel with repeat viewings. So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that ‘Dunkirk’ is another Nolan film that will reveal new aspects a second or even third time around.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> An epic battle between apes and humans will decide the future of both species on the planet.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>It’s almost 50 years since the original ‘Planet of the Apes’ starring Charlton Heston hit the screens back in 1968, and shocked audiences with its grim outlook of a world where apes evolve over humans to become the dominant species. In the current blockbuster scenario dominated by superheroes and intergalactic battles, it’s a challenge for this premise (and rebooted franchise) to remain relevant. However, co-writer and director Matt Reeves knows exactly why the post-apocalyptic tale worked in the late 60s and returns to those narrative roots, keeping its essence firmly grounded.<br>
