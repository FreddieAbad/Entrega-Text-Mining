"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Jack Sadelstien (Adam Sandler) has one big problem to deal with every year: The Thanksgiving event. But not so much for all that goes into the preparation for the big day, as much for his identical twin sister Jill's visit. But this year is going to be extra tough -- Jill wants to stay over forever... and ever...<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> When Adam Sandler gets on to tickling the funny bone, rest assured silly becomes normal. And now that there's a double doze of Sandler in here, you don't really need to guess where all that laughter riot comes from. Poop, blonde jokes, melon jokes and slapstick humour.<br>
<br>
First, there is Adam Sandler as the confident, calm and composed LA ad guy Jack Sadelstein. Second there is Adam Sandler (again) as Jill Sadelstein, Jack's identical twin sister. So far so good till Jill decides to take her annual trip -- the Thanksgiving bash at brother Jack's place. Naturally then, Mr Cool Guy swears by the topsy turvy mantra each time Jill leaves no stone unturned when it comes to embarrassing her brother in public. And caught between the two is Erin (Katie Holmes), who like most ideal wives plays perfect peacemaker between the siblings. You of course are caught between Jack's attempt to convince problem creator Jill to change her mind about her annual Thanksgiving visit (but in vain), followed by his attempts to get things right specially when Jill has a knack for getting things wrong. End result: chaos and the predictable that strangely keeps you entertained, like all Sandler films do.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Mumble the penguin has two problems. First, his son Erik is finding it hard to create a niche for himself in the dancing paradise. Second, dangers threaten the peace of the penguin nation. Can Mumble once again dance his way into a world where nature’s fury is calling the shots?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Nothing much seems to have changed in this cold Antarctic region, since the adorable two-awkward-feet tribe struck the screen. The penguins are in plenty, fights with killer seals and predator birds are still a norm, the Arctic ice still continues to melt. And like its Oscar nominated 2006 prequel, Happy Feet Two has enough food for thought too --- a whole lot of screen time on values, the importance of family, the urge to never give up on hope and tips on self-confidence. Keep that aside and there’s something different in this paradise of penguins that talks of human error, oil spills, global warming, melting ice caps too.<br>
<br>
The then dancing Mumble (Elijah Wood) now has a grown-up son, Erik (Ava Acres), who does not want to take after his dancing dad, but idolizes Sven (Hank Azaria) who can actually sail the skies. Watch the generation gap in here. Next is the big problem -- a giant iceberg traps most of the population including the likes of penguins, seals and krills. Of course, the ones to stand out are Will Krill (Brad Pitt) and Bill Krill (Matt Damon) who want to break free in every possible way. And Brad Pitt and Matt Damon do manage to stand out literally! However, it’s the sub-plot of the krills that takes away a bit from the Mumble-Erik storyline....<br>
<br>
But then we are not complaining. For the excellent music and dancing leaves you in a tap dance mode yourself. Also, the 3D’s definitely smarter, brighter and trendier. Special mention: catch the Antarctic iceberg attack in super trans effect.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) is a key aide of the campaign staff trying to get governor Mike Morris (George Clooney) elected president in the upcoming U.S. elections. But first he has to get out of a scandal he gets trapped in while campaigning for his boss. Will Meyers choose self over duty... pass the loyalty test and come out clean in this campaign of the power brokers?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> George Clooney as President of the United States? Oh yes, oh yes. For there would be hard to find a more charismatic contender from Hollywood. And with Matt Damon's name already being thrown around in the news as a possible candidate, the film grows intensely topical and great fun to watch. Clooney, with his characteristic command over his craft and his credible personality lends a gravitas to the role as Governor Mike Morris, a liberal Democrat who must convince Senator Thompson (Jeffrey Wright) of his capabilities for a nomination over his rival, Senator Pullman (Michael Mantell) for a Democratic nomination.<br>
<br>
Based on the play, Farragut North by Beau Willimon, the Ides of March is a punch political thriller which blazes across as it brings to life the intrigue, drama and nerve-wracking tenor of the long and complicated US elections. This is Circa 2011 and the primary vote is on March 15. Naturally then, politics, back stabbing, betrayal, sacrifices, compromises, scandals, bribery, blackmail are all part and parcel of this Star and Stripes labyrinth.<br>
<br>
Governor of Pennysylvia Mike Morris (George Clooney) is focused on the Democratic primary elections. All he wants is nothing but presidency -- something that calls for convincing Americans primarily with words. That’s when Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling), his mercurial press secretary steps in, not just helping the people of America to make the right choice. In short, Meyers is a winner at his job and the stage seems to be set for Morris, just when Meyers meets Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti), the other competent and veteran campaign manager for the rival candidate. For spoilers, Meyers gets involved with a not-so-innocent intern (Evan Rachael Woods), courtesy Tom, and realizes getting out of that scandal could mean paying a heavy price... Exactly when values are compromised upon, lie becomes truth and betrayal becomes the order of the day. The bigger drama stems from the fact ‘everybody wants to save themselves’.<br>
<br>
This one's an out and out Ryan Gosling movie who leaves no stone unturned to come up with a blazing performance. Of course, it's George Clooney, who as the Presidential nominee makes every dialogue (excellent screenplay) credible and carries the weight of the film on his shoulders. Great acts by Paul Giamatti and Philip Seymour Hoffman who add to the allure of the film.<br>
<br>
A political drama that’s real and intelligent, The Ides Of March is a thrilling watch.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> In 1863, Amsterdam Vallon returns to the New York City seeking revenge against Bill, his father's killer...<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> This one's a classic that traces the birth of America, not in civilised boardrooms where the principles of democracy are debated and pondered upon; but through bloody street brawls and hate crimes... A civilisation that was born out of savagery! Scorsese rips up the postcards of American history and reassembles them into a violent, blood-soaked story of a bare-knuckled past. The New York it portrays in the years between the 1840s and the Civil War is, as a character observes, 'the forge of hell', in which groups clear space by killing their rivals. The film opens with an extraordinary scene set in catacombs carved out of the Manhattan rocks where the leader of the immigrants gang -- an Irish-American named Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) -- prepares for battle with messianic zeal. With his young son Amsterdam (Leonardo) trailing behind, he walks through the labyrinth, gathering his forces, the Dead Rabbits, before stalking out into daylight to fight the forces of a rival American-born gang, the Nativists.<br>
<br>
In this animalistic battle, Vallon is slain by his enemy William Cutting, aka Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis). This was the famous gang fight of Five Points on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, recorded in American history. Amsterdam disappears into an orphanage, the ominously named Hellgate House of Reform, only to emerge as an avenging angel, hellbent on revenge. He joins Bill's gang and rises in the ranks to become almost like his foster son, until it is time to strike. In this brilliant, throbbing canvas, the lynchpin is Day-Lewis, effortlessly upstaging co-stars DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz. His Bill the Butcher is a terrifying psychopath with a glass eye that has an American eagle in place of a pupil. Scorsese's film is revisionist history, linking the birth of American democracy with American crime.

Having served a 14-year-long prison sentence after being convicted for rape, Cady emerges from prison determined to take revenge on his lawyer, Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), who, he feels, failed to do a good job as defense attorney.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> A biopic depicting the early years of legendary aviator Howard Hughes’ career, from the late 1920s to the mid-1940s...<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The boy has grown up. Leornado, who never joined the big league despite fine performances in films like Titanic and Romeo and Juliet, enters the actor’s adulthood with Aviator. Ostensibly, a biopic on America's greatest maverick millionaire, Howard Hughes who made his millions during the War, despite his eccentricities -- or is it due to his eccentricities -- the film is actually philosophy. On dreaming Big, aiming Big, achieving Big...<br>
<br>
The young boy who inherited his father's tool factory at the raw age of 18 and poured in its profits in sky-limit schemes has a story to tell the contemporary world. Of course, you might say that Howard was the quintessential capitalist that Adam Smith serenaded. But that's not Howard's real story. That he used his legacy to rewrite the rules of society and sculpt the future of a nation instead of recycling nuts and bolts is the moral of this modern day fable. When he was a kid, Howard told his mom: ``I want to make big planes and big movies...''. In short, make fantasy fact. That's what he did. And that's what every entrepreneur-dreamer needs to do.<br>
<br>
On the personal note too, the film scores as it traces the kinky man's affairs with two of Hollywood's most memorable women -- Katherine Hepburn (Cate) and Ava Gardner (Kate). Of the two, it's Cate Blanchett who matches up to the `all acute angles' personality of Howard and the chemistry between the two lights up the screen in rare colours. But the film belongs to Leonardo alone who grows from 18 to adulthood without losing the core of his character: a dreamer-doer who didn't quite have it right.

However, his two partners kill off everyone else involved in the robbery to reach the top of the mob hierarchy. But will Henry stoop that low to bring about the downfall of Jimmy and Tommy?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Based on Nicholas Pileggi's book Wiseguys, Good Fellas is the real-life story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), an Irish-Italian youngster who grew up as a foot soldier in the all-powerful New York, and later denounced it by switching sides. When the lure of the underworld diminished and the seamy side of mindless violence left him disillusioned, Hill joined the US government's witness protection programme and helped the law to catch up with his old comrades: the avuncular gent who stole for the love of it, Jim Conway (Robert De Niro) and the amiable killer who couldn't get a hold on his temper, Tommy Devito (Joe Pesci). Scorsese documents the highs and the lows, the power and the pulpy morals of the mafioso with characteristic expertise. Good Fellas is his greatest ode to the gangster with Ray Liotta pitching in a towering act as the guy who wanted to be a gangster rather than the President of America.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> A self-destructive boxer's journey gets tougher when violence and temper - his driving force in the ring -- ruins his life outside it...<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Martin Scorsese's biopic on Jake LaMotta, a middleweight prizefighter, who stepped out from the Bronx to make it big in the boxing ring in the 1940s, expertly lays bare the soul of the boxer. LaMotta (Robert De Niro) is an archetypal underdog who lives by brute force and has no time for sensitivity in his blood-splattered life. Love, for him, is a painful force that gets marred by jealousy, insecurities, self-doubt and abuse. He falls in love with a brazen teenager (Cathy Moriarty) whom he spots in a swimming pool. Yet, despite marrying her, he ends up in an emotionally battered relationship with her. Rated as one of Scorsese’s best films, Raging Bull has poignancy behind brute force: outward violence incipiently seeps into a man's insides and causes him to self-destruct. Robert De Niro, in the lead role, is all guts and fury especially in the hard-hitting boxing sequence. But his emotional sequences with brother Joe Pesci are classic cuts.

"<div class='Normal'>When mentally unstable Vietnam war veteran Travis gets home to work as a cabbie by night, what takes him by storm is the underbelly of New York city and its loss of values. His mission then is to clean NYC of its scum<br>
<br>
Enter the hell that exists within the mind and soul of a quintessential American in combat with an unjust system. A Vietnam War veteran, Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), returns home without having quelled the war within. He is a bundle of simmering rage that feeds and grows on the urban degradation of New York City, a concrete jungle that is even more dangerous than the Viet Cong-infested jungles of Vietnam. The moral degradation and incipient violence of city life turns Travis into a sociopath who roams the urban underbelly as the cuckoo cabbie man, hell-bent on clearing the scum -- weirdos, pimps, prostitutes -- off the cityscape. It’s a startling, disturbing picture of social disarray, with De Niro redefining the angst of a socially dysfunctional citizen who has been transformed into a rage machine. Catch Jodie Foster, a 12-year-old prostitute with piquant charm.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> When Tintin (Jamie Bell) buys the Unicorn, a showpiece boat from the flea market for a pound, little does he know the model is part of an unsolved puzzle. Till he finally meets the seafaring, liqour-loving Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) who helps him solve the mystery... and find the treasure trove...Of course all along danger threatens in the form of the evil Sakharine (Daniel Craig) who is hellbent on getting the boat and wreaking his ancestral vengeance against the Haddocks.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> It could have ended up as a heady cocktail of the Indiana Jones and the Pirates of the Caribbean series, but The Adventures of Tintin is so much more than recycled headiness. And that's because of its brilliant new technique of filming -- motion capture animation -- that literally brings to life Belgian artist Herge's lovable parade of characters, led by Tintin, the irrepressible reporter and Snowy, the smartest dog in town. Tintin and his encounters with evil in exotic lands already have a legion fans in India, but rest assured, they are bound to grow with this stylish new format of filmmaking which completely preserves the form and the atmospherics of the popular comic book.<br>
<br>
The story too is equally enticing with loads of action to pep up the tenor of the film. What starts of as a simple purchase for Tintin (Jamie Bell) soon turns out to be a ‘possible story’ for the reporter. The unicorn model, he realises, is the path to a bigger mystery -- the secret of the hidden treasure. But finding the hidden treasure calls for decoding a few lost symbols. That's where Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) of disputed ancestry steps in and helps Tintin find the gold believed to be buried in the oceans. But only after he fights his swashbuckling ghost from the past, Ivan Sakharine, who wants it all, by hook or by crook. Don't miss the thrilling flashback where the 17th century ship, the Unicorn, meets its tragic end, the crazy biplane ride to Morocco followed by one of the most chaotic chases where the entire town seems to be on a roller coaster ride, except the blumbering cops Thompson and Thomson.<br>
<br>
A special mention: While Jamie Bell fits into the role of Tintin with ease, not just for his ginger quiff but journalistic appetite too, Daniel Craig stands out as the evil and hideous Sakharine. But the ones who really become objects of affection are Andy Serkis (watch him resist every peg that comes his way) and Tintin's comrade, Snowy. The two actually bring ample comic relief when the endless journey seems a little stretched.<br>
<br>
But then all's well that ends well. And as Captain Haddock puts it, for there's more treasure lying deep down in the oceans that needs to be found. Sequel, Spielberg!

Hyperion might have unleashed his evil if the gods (Zeus) had not chosen a brave peasant, Theseus (Henry Cavill) to lead the war on behalf of the humans.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Big Indian interest? Frieda Pinto. As the virgin oracle who gets maximum screen time amongst the female cast, this should have been reason enough for Indians to claim the film as their own. More importantly, the fact that she chooses to give up her celestial status for more earthly pleasures and falls in love with the brawny peasant leader,<br>
<br>
Theseus, should have added adequate spice to the proceedings. But the problem with Immortals is its garbled screenplay, its lacklustre, almost lifeless action cuts, making the film end up as a pale shadow of the mesmerising 300. Heavily imbued with mythology, the film fails to connect. And the fact that Frieda pitches in a frozen act makes you feel miserable. The only actor who breathes life on screen is the wicked, crooked Mickey Rourke.<br>
Rest? Too placid.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Paul Kemp is a journalist without a mission who moves from New York to work for a major newspaper in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It's only when he deals with the Peurto Ricans and the American expats there does he find a real purpose -- not just to write on, but a mission for life...<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Johnny Depp ostensibly made this film for his journalist friend Hunter S Thompson who wrote the Rum Diary, a novel, in the 1960s but could get it published only in 1998. More importantly, he committed suicide before the film could see the light of day. He essays the role of Paul Kemp, a journalist who applies for a job in the San Juan Star in Puerto Rico and manages to get it because he is the only applicant.<br>
<br>
Paul begins like any disinterested expat journo who is more interested in savouring the delights of the exotic Caribbean. He makes friends with the photographer who runs a side business fighting cocks and ex-journalist Michael Rispoli who has given himself up to a degenerated life of booze and drugs. Depp too swings along the Jack Sparrow way until he meets land developer Aaron Eckhart and his mistress, Amber Heard. Eckhart uses his journalistic skills to write positive stories on his land schemes, but it doesn't take long before Depp realises the exact motives of the scheming blackguard. Time for the boozing bohemian to change into a man with a mission and become the voice of the common man...a voice in red ink and rage.<br>
<br>
The film is rich in atmospherics and captures the 1950's Puerto Rico beautifully. The screenplay is however a bit muddled and confusing here and there. But Depp is first rate and not to miss out is Richard Jenkins as the editor-in-chief who breathes the editorial policy: that of the American dream. A sure scene stealer after Depp. Finally, Eckhart is his usual dependable self with Amber Heard in a smouldering avatar.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Sawyer Nelson is in search of a perfect friend when he bumps into a dolphin one fine day. But the dolphin's got its own problems to deal with. Will bailing the dolphin out... and giving it a new life make the two best buddies?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>It ain't as simple as it looks. This one surely calls on all young adults to a) socialise b) never give up.<br>
<br>
One is lonely and friendless. The other is friendly but lonely. So they are bound to meet. But not that easily when one's a human, the other a dolphin. How then do they meet? Young Sawyer Nelson (Nathan Gamble) is happy (and lonely) in his world of PS3s when he on his way back from school sees Winter's (the dolphin) tail twisted in a giant lobster's trap. Human instinct follows next: friendship and a call to the animal rescuers. But then life for Winter turns topsy turvey when it has to get rid of its tail. Time for artificial intelligence -- Sawyer gets the animal a prosthetic tail and teaches it how to swim too. As for Winter, she's done her part -- it's when Sawyer is all out helping, saving and teaching the dolphin to swim does he break from his introvert shell.<br>
<br>
And while all this happens, you just can't get enough of some moments to capture. Watch Sawyer and Winter bond. Indeed friendship has no language... just whistles could work wonders. Next is Ashley Judd as Sawyer's mother who fails to understand her son's isolation. In fact, there are times when you actually feel as helpless as she is. And lastly, it's none other than Morgan Freeman as Dr Cameron McCarth who stands out as a symbol of the never-give-up spirit till he finds the right tail to suit the dolphin. Had it not been for Nathan and Freeman, Winter would have been an all out winner in here.<br>
<br>
But strangely, Winter is still the real winner. She is the same dolphin, who a few years back, lost a tail and now functions admirably with an artificial one. Kudos to a sweet family film!

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Working as a manager for a posh condominium in one of the prime locations of the Big Apple is perhaps the best job for Josh Kovacs (Ben Stiller). Or so it seems, till he realises the owner Arthur Shaw is a man of loot. He not only seems to be robbing his people of what they have, but also what they've saved for the future. Mission for Josh: to get someone like Slide, Eddie Murphy, who can help restore what is lost...<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Ironically more than the heist in this tower, it's the stopping all that heist that makes it worth a visit. What heist? Josh Kovacs works along with his team (including Casey Affleck) round the clock each day to impress their penthouse owner Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) -- also a dealer of priceless modern art. But then what they do not know is that the FBI is on the hunt because Shaw is looting his employees of their pension and investment plans. Now that they know it, obviously they've got to stop it. How? Kovacs recruits a team to break into the apartment and steal all his money. But what they find is much more that they can dream of -- Shaw's most prized possession, a bright red 1953 Ferrari, once owned by Steve McQueen. The daunting task of course is to get the priceless car out of the penthouse which has no door and no elevators. And that's when the tower turns into one of chaos and comic confusion, courtesy Slide.<br>
<br>
If Eddie Murphy is the one who plans how to get that big red Ferrari out of the penthouse, rest assure there's enough for the funny bone in here. As Slide, he's someone quite familiar with crime sans the basic -- when you break into an apartment you don't talk too loud. Blame it on his petty street thefts. And that's the way he is -- a next door dude straight from the streets of Central Park who doesn't mind cussing quite often.<br>
<br>
Watchable not so much for how they plan to get the car out of the building, especially as the Thanksgiving Day Parade passes directly below, as much for Eddie Murphy doing what he does best -- curse and make you laugh.<br>

A fun film.<br>

Anybody above 25 years has just one year to live unless he can buy time. He meets stranger Henry Hamilton who gifts him a century before committing suicide. Enter the Time keepers, the Intelligence Agency that fails to understand how a not-so-well-off Salas suddenly has a century gifted to him. Did he murder Henry? More importantly, what does Salas plan to do now that he has all that time in the world...<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Sensuous Olivia Wilde plays Justin Timberlake's mother, and she's fifty now while Justin's just turned 25. She's just one of the many inhabitants of this zombieland where humans stop aging at 25, but can live beyond that provided they can buy time. Yes, the idea is to keep recharging life -- an easy job for the super rich who already have a million years on them, but an expensive and tedious task for the unfortunate few. And that's where Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) comes in. The ghetto kid wants to save his dying mother but doesn't know how until he meets a stranger, Henry Hamilton one fine day, who gifts him a century before jumping off a bridge. Enough to put then-poor-now-uber rich man under suspect. Where did he get all that time from, they wonder. But even before you actually think you know it, you are irresistibly thrown into the riveting time warp...<br>
<br>
First there are day-to-day activities of the contemporary world translated into time: it costs a decade to book a suite, two hours is all you need to debit from life as toll tax or maybe a few seconds of life is what you pay for a night of sex. How? Swipe your wrist against the machine and time's debited from your account (read life). That's exactly what Justin's seen doing. Till he finds love in multimillionaire (she has untold centuries on her clock) Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried), who helps him when on the run... and ends up falling in love. Naturally then, their motto is the same: to make the world an equal place. After all, why should the rich live forever, while the poor have to fend for every second. Time to rob time (read banks) like Bonnie and Clyde and distribute it like Robin Hood to the poor and needy.<br>
<br>
Now don't just watch this one for the buying and selling of time. First, watch for it Cillian Murphy as the selfish, sophisticated time keeper in a not-so-distant world where time is money. Second, watch it for those speedy car chases and crashes, gun shots and other adrenaline pumping stuff. Third, see it for Justin Timberlake who once again belts a fine and convincing performance perfectly matched with the understanding Amanda Seyfried. Next, it's some real moments in time: Olivia failing to making it to Justin by a nano second, Justin and Amanda ready to give up their last few seconds for each other in the final part now that time is love (you actually wish the two never time out), the fate changing win of Justin after a game of arm conflict. Fifth, watch it for the technique: You end up keeping a tab on how much time's left for all, courtesy the fluorescent green digital clock that keeps ticking off every century, year, month, week, hour, second... on every forearm. And if that's not all, finally watch it for some thought provoking questions: Why do we have to die? Why does the cost of living always go up and never down? Hasn't evolution been unfair to every passing generation? Quite real with all that current talk of the immortality gene for the rich. Intelligent cinema.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Kathy Bolkovac is a Nebraskan cop who is most willing to spread the good news in post-war Bosnia. Her mission, according to her, is simple: spread the message of peace and humanity. But before the message actually reaches out to the locals, there’s a dark world that needs to be crossed – a world primarily of human trafficking. Can Kathy break the barriers of the big, bad world and spread the message of humanity... especially when the dark kingdom is ruled by her own people -- private contractors from within the police force, the army and the diplomatic circle?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> It’s never been easy for a whistleblower. Even if the one in question is the real-life inspired character of Rachel Weisz. She plays Kathy Bolkovac, a former cop who once served as a peacekeeper in Bosnia and got on the wrong side of the U.N. for covering up a sex scandal. Now analyze this: They say domestic violence against Muslim women in Bosnia is something that ought to be confined to their homes; she says domestic violence is the most gruesome form of torture. They say girls in Bosnia selling themselves for sex are prostitutes out of choice; No reason to disbelieve, since the Bosnian Badlands have hit the headlines, time and again.<br>
<br>
So what are Kathy's option? Should she quietly continue her job for the fatter pay cheque or is it time to play whistleblower? The choice is clear for the steely woman with the fragile exterior. Specially when she realises complicity in crime lies at home too: amidst the evil old boy's club of men in uniform who run the country like their private fiefdom. Amidst the beauty of the snow covered fields does she find a human trafficking racket where girls are not just provided as objects of desire for the sex starved man, but to the very men in blue. Naturally then, no sooner does Kathy don the role of a whistleblower, the system works against her -- non cooperation, questioning senior officers, transfer orders, missing files and missing witnesses...<br>
<br>
Watch it for Rachel as a body of patience, calm, determination and composure even during moments of helplessness while she is stripped off her last power. Special mention: the only time she actually bursts into fits of rage against the system -- she questions the system, she questions humanity, she questions countries and their policies.<br>

Not that easy, expecially when all this happens in New York...and the time limit is one night. But just when you think this one's going to be yet another romcom against the backdrop of the Big Apple, you feel a little surprised.<br>

That's because there is a sensitivity in the narrative and the performances are credible.<br>

So that despite deja vu, you don't despair with this finely crafted film.<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> 2007. 2010. And now 2011. Ever since this low budget creep show hit the screen with its grainy footage of things that go bump in the night, the franchise has become a cult with serious fans waiting for the new one. This one's supposed to be a prequel to the earlier films and here too, except for a few scenes employing a hand-held camera, all the action is shown from three VHS machines: one in a couple's bedroom, one in the attic with the kids and a third attached to the base of a fan on the ground floor. Enough to capture mom Julie (Luaren Bittner) and her love making moments with her boyfriend, her daughters Katie and Kristi (in the year 1988) celebrating birthdays, talking to the invisible entity, befriending the ghost and ultimately being a victim of the not-so-friendly member of the house. Not to say there is just creaking and door slams sending a couple of chills down the spine. Consider this: a baby sitter jumping in front of a camera, a weird figure under a sheet... But then all is lost to the tedious intervals between each scary moment and too much of camera running into non-happening space and time.<br>

It’s the same time when young D'Artagnan moves to Paris to fulfill his dream of becoming a musketeer. The task before him is plenty: punish a beautiful spy within the kingdom, expose the cardinal and his evil motifs of capturing the French throne and ultimately diverting war within Europe. Does the wannabe musketeer manage to shoo away the inevitable alone? Or does it take a joint effort of the three original musketeers?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> We’ve read it all. And we’ve seen it all too. But this one’s a little different: Imagine Alexandre Dumas’ evergreen 1970 classic tale in a new avatar -- leather-clad scuba divers, sky battles in air ships, infra red beams, sword plays between troops on high rise buildings.... Just look at the musketeers -- Parthos (Ray Stevenson), Athos (Mathew MacFadyen) and Aramis (Luke Evans) -- as superheroes, and you might end up liking this one, especially when you realize the not-so-faithful-one lies within the kingdom.<br>
<br>
Nothing seems to get the three musketeers back into action after a sour love affair and a betrayal. Till they meet an aspiring musketeer D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) who convinces them not just to get back into action, but also save the Queen (Juno Temple) from disgrace. Exactly where you get your dose of adrenalin. And exactly where you get a little disappointed. The special effects in 3D form don’t really keep you on the edge of your seat. Case in point: The fireball sequences and the theft of the necklace under UV rays. Ample scope wasted. Not to miss out, a word about the performances. If Orlando Bloom is villainous as Buckingham, Milla Jovovich's sultry Milady is devious. As for the musketeers, their claim to fame in their own words: ‘We drink and fight troops and drink.’ Unfortunately, that’s what they are left doing except for the initial forty against four sword sequence.<br>
<br>
But then are we really complaining? Not really, for under the battle sequences and war machines, lies the more real and contemporary spirit of a musketeer: You’ve got to take risks in life, you’ve got to fail to rise, you’ve got to get into fights... and if you have to choose between honour and love, love it must be. Even now. An old story told with modern finesse.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Ally Darling (Anna Faris) is on the crossroads of life. Having just been fired from her job and broken up with her boyfriend, she hears about about a Harvard research which says that women who have had 20 sexual partners before marriage might never get married. Why? Men are wary of them. Well, Ally's already had 20 boyfriends and life doesn't seem too good, until she begins to see her bohemian neighbour (Chris Evans) in a new light. Hope beyond the tunnel?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Anna Faris seems to have a natural flair for comedy and fits into the shoes of a rom-com actor, almost perfectly. Her sundry musings on her sex life and her future prospects make for some amusing moments, as do her attempts to ferret out all her old boyfriends so that she can settle down with one of them, without having to cross the dreaded figure of 20. The fact that she enlists the support of her quirky neighbour, who believes only in one-night stands, adds to the fun and games. The chemistry between the two has a crackling sheen to it.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> In a turbo charged futuristic setting, the favourite sport for the human species is robot boxing. Failed boxer Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) keeps trying to win these with his scrap-style, old-fashioned bots and ends up running from towns in his monster truck to escape the mounting debts. Troubles compound when he discovers he has an 11-year-old son Max (Dakota Goyo) who needs a dad, after his mother dies. But the reluctant dad is willing to take custody, only for the summer, and that too after being paid a hefty sum by the kid's prospective foster parents. Needless to say, the summer turns out to be a monumental one where new bonds are forged and an antiquated robot, Atom, found in a scrap yard, becomes the new age champion of Bot bravado.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> A real steal, this new film from Hugh Jackman which is imbued with so much heart, so much soul and is so high-spirited, it brings you to your feet too to avidly cheer the proverbial underdog. And when it doesn't have you playing the flamboyant cheerleader for the father-son duo -- and their outmoded, yet adorable robot -- it has you shedding silent tears for the tender re-awakening of the most primordial, most natural bonds between a father and his estranged son. And no, the actors themselves aren't shedding tears (they would, in Bollywood); instead, they are tugging at your heartstrings with their awkward attempts to reach out or resist in this dysfunctional relationship that has nothing going right for it, yet strangely does seem to be moving towards a perfect future.<br>
<br>
Hugh Jackman's Charlie Kenton is the most unusual father figure to hit the recent screen. On hearing about the existence of his son from two strangers, after losing all his money and his robot in a fight, he asks: Is he dead? On being told the contrary, he doesn't bat an eyelid before selling him off for a thousand dollars to foster parents, simply because he needs the money to buy a new robot and enter the boxing rings again. Naturally then, he is infuriated with the idea of being saddled with the 11-year-old for the summer -- another deal -- and doesn't think twice before trying to leave him with his girlfriend, Evangeline Lilly, while he hits the road, a free man again.<br>
<br>
But young Max, bred on a culture of video games and bot boxing, is the smartest cookie in town. Not the one to be left out of the fun and games, he bribes his way into his father's truck...and gradually into his life too. This time, with his adorable ways, which aren't too different from his dad. For Max is brusque, stubborn, determined, a boy of few words and knows his mind too well to be pushed around. More importantly, he's the smartest 11-year-old in town, as he goes about rebuilding the robot he single-handedly rescues from a scrap yard and prepares it for his dad. Now, it's dad's turn to turn the shadowboxing relic from the past into a boxing champ...And somewhere amidst the guts and glory of the boxing bouts, the duo discover each other too.<br>
<br>
Everything seems to fall into place in this film. The cross-country setting of desolate American towns coupled with the glitzy finale are spell-binding. The performances of both Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo are mesmerising. Even Evangeline Lilly is winsome and sweet as the girlfriend who wants to give up this unsuitable man, but simply can't. But more importantly, it's the story and the screenplay (John Gatin) which cement the whole show together into a perfect whole.<br>
<br>
Anybody out there making a film on bots? This one's a classic on how to blend techno-splendour with high emotions, without going all mushy and sentimental. Sporty. Soft. Super. Scram for it.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Doraemon and Nobita get together to create the perfect toy robot. Little do they know their creation can do much more than be the object of kido admiration and entertainment...<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Now this one's out and out for the kiddies' party out there. Not just for its entertainment quotient -- brightly coloured and smart animation, decent voice overs, loads of planning and action -- but also for its most contemporary message: Time to save planet Earth.<br>

After years of admiration for Sueno's robot, Nobita finally convinces Doraemon to create a similar special robot. What next? The two are out collecting bits and pieces to assemble the robot toy of their dreams. However, the raw material gathered actually belongs to a special robot who dismantled once from the heavens.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Two wannabe criminals kidnap pizza delivery guy, Jesse Eisenberg, strap a bomb around his chest and give him ten hours to rob a bank...or end up dead. Will Jesse deliver?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> This should have actually been one of the smartest films off Hollywood's coveyor belt, this year, coming straight after two trailblazers from the lead actor and the director. If Jesse Eisenberg hits the screen after his wow performance in The Social Network, then Ruben Fleischer returns with a second film after the high octane, whacky winner, Zombieland.<br>
<br>
Okay, 30 Minutes...isn't a fitting follow-up to neither of them. The setting, the story and the sequences are quite banal compared to the earlier films. Nevertheless, there is some high energy performances and an effervescent spirit that keeps the goofy film galloping in its short span. Leading the actor's bandwagon is the talented Mr Eisenberg who seems to add new dimensions to your friendly neighbourhood pizza boy who can successfuly double up as a bank robber too. Aiding him in his antics is the spirited Aziz Ansari, his childhood buddy who is responsible for his parents' divorce (funny aside!) The other Indian American in the caper is Dilshad Vadsaria, Ansari's twin who turns up the temperature for buddy Jesse. Of course, Ansari ain't cool with that, but does love care....<br>
<br>
Crazy bank heists, gangster encounters and car chases make for some funny situations which keep the minutes flying. The film delivers the goods.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Nothing matters most to Driver (Ryan Gosling) than being in total control of the wheel, both by day and at night. Till there is an urgency to change gears. Reasons? First, he inevitably becomes the target of a plot gone wrong. Second, he realises there is more to life than high speed chases...<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> He has no past. No present. No future. All we know about him is his dedication towards his job. Meet Driver -- sans a name, sans a life and sans any emotion -- who is the perfect man behind the wheel. Be it daytime when he's a stunt driver for action movies or night time when he turns into a getaway driver for crooks who need his services to speed off after heists and escape cops. There are just two places where Driver scores -- first the time is money mantra. No wonder he loves his watch and five minutes is all he assigns to crooks on the run. For the rest, he says, 'you need to be on your own'. Second, of course, his knowledge of LA streets. Enter edge of the seat chase, special effects, high collides, and breath taking toppling over of speed devils.... Great action. High tension.<br>
<br>
Of course, the brakes in Driver's never ending hide and seek chase come from Ryan's neighbour, a young mother Irene (Carey Mulligan) -- who, like Driver, carries scars of the past -- and her son Benecio (Kaden Leos). How? It's only when Irene's convict ex husband draws the Driver and his own family into a viscous gangwar to make a quick buck does the man realise he's losing balance. Watch out for Driver melt during his moments of love for Irene... and when playing father figure to Benecio. That's exactly when you realise the man of unpredictable moods and moments... of barely few words... of unblinking gaze, is actually running from ghosts of the past and chasing dreams of a better road ahead.<br>
<br>
Worth getting behind the wheel this weekend, both for the drives and for the driver. Don't miss this action-bender which got a standing ovation at Cannes.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> High Schooler Taylor Lautner suddenly finds his ordinary life turn tumultuous -- and traumatic -- when he discovers his childhood photograph on a missing person's website and learns the truth about his antecedents. After that, it is a life-and-death mission as he gets embroiled in an international espionage operation, involving the CIA and some deadly Serbian rogue intelligence operators and where he must escape his unknown assailants, girlfriend (Lily Collins) in tow.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Amazing first date, Lautner tells his girlfriend as the two get a moment of respite from all the running and fleeing. Needless to say, he has reason to feel this way, since the date began with the murder of his foster parents, followed by a bomb blast which blew away his house and ensured that the teenage lovers spent the rest of the screen time dodging bullets and hiding from a bunch of ruthless killers who were determined to lay their hands on Lautner, any which way. Yes, they do manage to steal a few kisses in between.<br>
<br>
Turns out, Lautner is the secret kid of spy parents and has inherited their special skills which serve him well when he needs to fight back, either the suspicious CIA agent Alfred Molina or the Serbian gangster and his gang of ruthless assassins. So Lautner fans have loads to look out for in the bicep and brawn department, with the young hero displaying his martial skills with expertise. Is Jacob, the werewolf, hoping to carve a niche for himself as the new action hero? Of course, we're not forgetting the slot of the new hottie too, which Lautner seems to have already taken with his Twilight series outings. Here too, he gets to remove his shirt, not once but twice, to display his perfectly sculpted physique which quite makes up for the lack of expression. Reminds you of a young Arnie (Schwarzenegger), our young TayLau!<br>
<br>
Truly, a befitting breakaway attempt, Abduction proves that Lautner has more to him than being a sidekick to Robert Pattinson's vampire hero in the Twilight films.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Last time he was sent to a missionary in Tibet after having embarrassed the MI7 in a mission failure. But this time he's the only one who can perhaps divert an attempt on the Chinese Premier's life. The question is can Johnny English really unfold a web of conspiracy running through the various secret services, especially now that he has just a week to do the job?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> So what if he does not have a suave knack for accomplishing missions successfully? So what if he acts as a nerd-cum-wannabe James Bond? And so what if he does not fit into the intelligent world of gadgets... this time mystery, spies and the missing link? There's something about Rowan Atkinson that suspense becomes the surprise element even if that means moving from Mr Beans to a sequel of Johnny English (the earlier version was released in 2003). Enter the scene of crime -- MI7 learns there is a plot to assassinate the Chinese premier the day world delegates are to meet. The suspense grows further when Johnny English realises there's a loophole at the MI7 end itself. But then the real suspense is watching Johnny put the next (and wrong) foot forward. Imagine Atkinson trying to get logic into his acts, minding his own business and putting a straight, serious face at most times.<br>
<br>
But then it would be wrong to say Johnny is the only one tickling the funny bone out there. What would all that hopelessness be without his boss Pamela (Gillian Anderson) providing him with sidekick Agent Tucker (Daniel Kaluuya) and ultimately the spoof on Bond -- Johnny's very first mission at Casino Lisboa in Macau (remember Casino Royale?), his stint with Bond girl Rosamund Pike (Die Another Day) as the confused psycho-analyst, and his flair for gadgets gone wrong.<br>
<br>
Just one problem. How much can you laugh at people walking into stuff, falling off nowhere, and having their private parts bang here and there? Actually lots. All in all, Johnny English is a fun film to watch at the weekend with Rowan Atkinson showing off his characteristic flair for comedy once again.

Although he loves his job, he might just have to leave it and become a suited-booted car salesman instead, on the behest of his materialistic girlfriend Stephanie (Leslie Bibb). Stephanie feels Griffin could be her dream man, if only he wasn't a zookeeper. But will the animals of the zoo let their favourite zookeeper depart, specially when they have decided to break their code of silence and begin to talk like humans, tutoring the bumbling lover boy Griffin on how to win his mate?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> What can you say about a man who hopes to learn the art of mating from a bunch of zoo animals! Naturally, the quadrupeds have strange ways of winning their mates, like marking territory by peeing, grabbing attention by throwing poop or showing your value by arousing jealousy. Gullible Griffin thinks these beastly antics might just work in winning back the urbane Stephanie who rejected his romantic proposal five years ago, simply because he was too much into birds, bees and beasts.<br>
<br>
Strangely, they do work and Stephanie finds herself being drawn to this new, unpredictable, animalistic and wild goofball who is even willing to don a tie and sell Mercs to please her. But is Stephanie a tad late in trying to woo back her ex, specially when Griffin has already established two new bonds: the first with the friendly, helpful in-house veterinarian, Rosario Dawson and the second with the monk-like gorilla (voice-over by Nick Nolte) who sheds his vow of silence after befriending the zookeeper.<br>
<br>
Zookeeper works not so much with Kevin James' antics as the bumbling hero, bogged down by his ordinariness, but more so when the animals begin to talk. The lion and his mate get interesting voice-overs by Slyvester Stallone and Cher, the gorilla's angst comes through Nick Nolte's rumblings while the rude monkey finds a voice in Adam Sandler's cheeky one-liners. Also, the chemistry between James and Dawson sparkles and adds life to the drama, despite the fact it has very little screen time to grow.<br>
<br>
Nothing monumental, nevertheless Zookeeper is timepass fare for the family.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> The Weavers, Cal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore), are the perfect couple, living out the American dream with a nice suburban home, nice jobs and two nice kids. But one seemingly innocuous dinner date turns out to be a disaster when Emily declares she has slept with her office colleague (Kevin Bacon) and wants a divorce since the high school romance between the huband wife duo seems to have lost its magic. Singleton status however suits neither, as Cal begins to spend wild, albeit soulless nights in lounge bars, under the tutelage of his newfound swinging bachelor friend (Ryan Gosling) and Emily leads a lonely, miserable life. Add to this two more love stories and you have a montage on the varied colours of romance.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> It may be a romantic story all over again but there is a freshness to Crazy Stupid Love which makes it eminently watchable. The characters are familiar: a middle-aged couple, a young couple and a teenage couple. Yet, their trajectory of romance is not so familiar. The middle-aged, much-married and recently separated Weavers try hard to go their separate ways but being quintessential soulmates, they never end up distanced and truly divorced. The 25-year old romance which began in high school with a chocolate mint ice cream is impossible to write off, however tempting the new options may seem. After all his heady encounters, which include one with wild cat school teacher Marisa Tomei (hilarious), Cal always ends up at Emily's doorstep, tending to their garden in the dead of night.<br>

Naturally then, the couple choose to split thereby putting an end to not just the brotherly bond between Tommy and Brendan, but also their training in MMA. Now fourteen years later, the brothers once again are face to face when they return to the ring, fighting against each other. But are the brothers actually facing each other as mere opponents or are the two fighting their ghost from the past?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> This one’s high on testosterone -- brutal martial arts with solid punches. And it’s equally high on EQ too -- emotionally packaged with rewards. On one hand there’s Brendan, a fighter-turned-physics teacher who can barely make ends meet for his wife and two daughters. On the other hand is Tommy, an ex Marine guy on the run from Iraq who too is on the lookout for ways better to earn a livelihood. What better way to earn that fast buck than put their childhood skills into practice. The duo enroll for an MMA Sparta competition to win that a cash prize of $ 5million. That’s when the brothers meet (along with their father) after fourteen odd years. Simple? Not really. For the brothers have to fight each other...Tommy has to get back to daddy for that extra lesson on MMA -- something he just can't get himself to believe...Brendon first has issues of the past to be resolved with his father. And that’s where you realise that it’s not just about a battle of the biceps, but about a troubled past, moments of regrets and coming to terms with family equations.<br>

Within two days she is dead and the doctors tell her grieving husband, Matt Damon, they don't know why she died. Before Damon can come to terms with his loss, the epidemic spreads the world over and nearly millions succumb to it within a short span of time. Panic spreads, governments are thrown into a tizzy, riots break out and the profiteers begin to reap gold. Can a civilised world cope with a deadly virus or are we still as ill-equipped as we were during the plague outbreak?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Contagion is topical, slick, fast-paced and embellished with a stellar ensemble cast that keeps you engrossed in the drama, despite the fact that most of them don't take much of screen time. The three doctors, Kate Winslet, Jennifer Ehle and Marion Cotillard make brief appearances in the film, but their contribution to the development of the plot is by no means minimal. Laurence Fishburne, as the reputed official representative, torn between principles and a personal transgression for a loved one, is as human as you can get. How many people wouldn't use their clout and break the queue to get a vaccine for somebody they love? Hardly any. Matt Damon as the common man left at the mercy of fumbling officialdom and social anarchy etches a picture perfect role of a man desperate to save his daughter, even if it means locking her up at home and depriving her of all social contact. Then, there is Gwyneth Paltrow, quite unforgettable as the deliciously naughty business woman who doesn't mind hooking up with her ex, while her husband and son wait for her at home: another brief role that last longer than its screen time. And finally, Jude Law as the rogue blogger is mesmerising with his rebellious streak that chooses to question all the players in this high drama and throw light on the nefarious deals between governments and pharmaceutical companies which make the most when death strikes.<br>
<br>
The high point of Soderbergh's film is its tone: never sensationalist, always restrained and therefore credible. With the world grappling with sundry new epidemics -- SARS, Mad Cow Disease, Swine Flu -- Contagion has an expediency to it which makes it eminently watchable. Doesn't seem too far-fetched, this threat of a new and deadly disease that originates from a bat and a pig and spreads through something as unavoidable as human touch. Time to be scared. Really scared.<pi></pi>

<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Meet Conan (Jason Momoa) the bad teen with a bad temper who grows up to be the good man killing bad people in the big bad world. For him there's nothing better than to `crush your enemies and see them driven before you... and hear the lamentation of their women'. Why? Because he's got to get back to those who killed his mother and father in the battleground. Like all epic heroes this one too takes up the task of saving his village from the powerful supernatural evil forces. Which means loads of bloody moments with monsters, enemies, evil powers, head crushing, nose chopping, merciless slaughters... Let's not forget, all this comes naturally to our hero -- Conan was born in middle of the battlefield!<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Loosely based on Iraqi soldier Latif Yahia's autobiographical novel, The Devil's Double, which became a bestseller in 2003, during the US campaign against Saddam Hussein, the film is a political thriller that focuses on the conditions in Baghdad before the first Gulf War.<br>
<br>
It traces the traumatic events in the life of the Iraqi soldier (Dominic Cooper) who was pulled from the front and brought into the palace at Baghdad to play Uday Hussein's body double. Now that wasn't an easy task for the gentleman soldier since Saddam Hussein's eldest son was actually the devil incarnate, as portrayed in the film. Did Latif manage to escape this living hell where the only bright spot seemed to be Uday's mistress, Sarrab (Ludivine Sagnier) who seems to favour the double over the real prince?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The film may kowtow the American interpretation of Iraq as the proverbial badland under the Saddam regime, but there is a contemporaneity to it which lends it a novel appeal. The US invasion of Iraq, post 9/11 and the images of the capture of the Iraqi dictator, following the death of his two sons, Uday and Qusay, are still fresh in public memory. Moreover, the events of history have transcended the format of clinical factoids and have been cleverly moulded as a thriller, more like the Bourne identity films, by director Lee Tamahori who directed the Bond film, Die Another Day.<br>
<br>
The high point of the film is the performance by British actor Dominic Cooper who sculpts a sterling act, both as Uday, the black prince and Latif, the fearless and sensitive man of principles. Cooper brings out the contrast between the two polarised characters with great felicity. With Uday, he introduces a mean swagger and an evil glint as he goes about his debauch, trigger-happy ways, chasing young schoolgirls, wallowing in the hedonism of drugs and alcohol and unleashing his terror on subordinates and colleagues. With Latif, he aptly brings out the trauma of a man trapped in a virtual hell, being forced to act against his conscience, almost every moment of the day, and perform tasks which he would never do otherwise. He does try hard to transcend the cesspool of moral decay, but escape is the only way out. And escape would surely mean death...either to him or his family.<br>
<br>
It's an ostentatiously mounted, although a somewhat meandering film, which creates high drama out of cut and dried political facts. Don't miss it.<br>

Of course, there are lots of things to recommend....Like, Jessica Alba who must be the most glamorous spy on board in her tights with a baby tied on to her. Or else, the talking dog-robot who spices up the proceedings with his sundry modes, attack and sentry being some of them.

The canvas of the film reads like a delightful bedtime book and brings back memories of childhood...Pooh and his friends even get to kick up some riotous fun with the alphabets and words that tumble all over the page/screen.<br>
<br>
Of course, one can't undermine the perennial allure of Pooh and his pals who have been charming us for so many years with their innocent adventures. Once again, it is Pooh's hunny-fixation, Eeyore's melancholia, Tigger's brawn show, Piglet's faint-heartedness and Owl's faulty wisdom that make the tale sweet and interesting.<br>
<br>
The film is largely meant for a younger audience but Disney fans are spread over all ages and nationalities.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> It's 1941. Brooklyn boy Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is desperate to enlist in the US army and play his part in defeating the Nazis. But he is consistently rejected due to his skinny, diminutive and unfit physical condition. Enter Dr Erskine (Stanley Tucci), a military scientist who recognises his true qualities (valour, coupled with goodness) and chooses to transform him into a super soldier with his special serums and his invincible metal shield. It doesn't take long for Captain Rogers, now christened Captain America to emerge a brave and brawny symbol of American superpower as he takes on the might of the evil German scientist Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), now known as the mighty Hydra -- even mightier than Hitler himself.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> He's almost like Iron Man, this new Marvel comic's hero, Captain America. Of course, Chris Evans doesn't have the chutzpah of and sardonic charm of Robert Downey Jr which makes Iron Man a rockstar amongst superheroes. But he does have a lot of heart and brings an integrity to his role as he metarmophoses from scrawny side hero Steve Rogers to towering inferno Captain America.<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The Final Destination films may be pure kitsch with their grotesque celebration of the carnival of death, nevertheless, they have a faithful following amongst patrons of gore. Once again, the film primarily focuses on the sundry ways death can strike. And rest assured, the more bizarre, the better....<br>
<br>
And the fact that one of the youngsters (Nicholas D'Agosto) is prescient and can actually foresee the tragedies hardly reduces their misery. Each member of the unfortunate group faces a gruesome and unpredictable end as screws, electrical short circuits, laser beams, factory and gym equipment and even harmless drops of water become death traps.<br>

The death scenes have shock value and sometimes end up as funny too: black humour, you see. Often, you have to shut your eyes at the sheer bloodiness of it all. Go, test your appetite for gore.<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Don't mess with nature: this is the simple message of this superbly mounted film. But more than the simplicity of the message, it is the fact that this must be one of the warmest and most humane sci fi fantasies of late that makes Rise of the Planet of the Apes such a gripping saga. Unlike most science films, this one doesn't boast of special effects alone, although the revolt of the super intelligent primates and their war against the residents of San Francisco is the stuff mega movie lore is made of. Watch the apes storm across the Golden Gate bridge, chase cars, smash them down, jump into helicopters, tear them apart and send the super human species reeling for cover and you have relentless moments of high drama on screen. Equally enthralling is the secret uprising in the animal facility where Caesar infuses a sense of dignity in the rest of the apes who are used to being maltreated by the cruel handlers. Surely and surely, the animals mutate into super-charged entities that unleash a war for supremacy against humans who have been using them as guinea pigs for their sundry unethical experiments. But all this scientific stuff has such a high emotional quotient to it, it not only makes the film intensely warm and sensitive but infuses a soul in it.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Mr and Mrs O’Brien (Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain), parenting in the glorious 1950s, want to build the ideal American (read Indian too) family with their three young boys. Living in an idyllic suburban home, the parents try their best to strike the right balance between discipline and gentleness. But bringing up kids in a world that isn’t always too kind and follows its own brutal laws isn’t an easy task, the family gradually discovers.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>You can love him or hate him but you simply cannot ignore him. That’s the kind of reaction auteur film maker Terence Mallick always elicits. The maverick director has a very individualistic style of film making which is often dubbed as self-indulgent and somewhat dense. But for those who like their cinema experimental, innovative and beyond convention, The Tree of Life offers both moments of pure visual splendor and loads of philosophical musings on life, love, family and the fragile nature of human relationships.<br>
<br>
Mr and Mrs O’Brien’s parenting styles are totally different. While Brad Pitt essays the role of the tiger dad - a strick disciplinarian - and insists on being called Father rather than Dad, Jessica Chastain is the gentle home-maker and nurturer. In fact, she even resents her husband and protests when he gets too harsh with the boys. It’s Jack (Hunter McCracken), the eldest son, who bears the brunt of his father’s authoritarianism and dramatically oscillates between extreme love and hate for a man he wants to please, any which way. After a confused boyhood of tense family dinners, squabbles, punishments and rebellion, he grows up into a man (Sean Penn) who is still trying to come to terms with the meaning of life. And that’s only because he knows his father wasn’t mean or vicious but loved him more than anything else. Ah! The unfathomable contradictions of life.<br>
<br>
The story line may be simple, but Mallick uses loads of style to narrate it. The first half hour is a special stunner where he expounds the entire theory of evolution through a series of exotic visuals, brought to life by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. The film boasts of fine performances, specially by Brad Pitt and the young McCracken and spills over with so much mood and atmospherics, it’s bound to strike a chord. Specially since it tells a universal story of growing up with parents who often don’t seem to be your best friends.<br>

Of course, first he must strike a harmonious relationship with Harrison Ford, an acerbic rancher who happens to be a brave warrior too.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Now some would term this a weird concoction. But if you have a yen for funky cocktails, then Cowboys and Aliens might just tease your palate with its unusual mix of extra terrestrials and wild west heroes.<br>
<br>
The film works mostly through its whacky encounters between the strange-looking invaders and the bunch of brave humans who settle all their differences to wage this one final battle to save the world. The fact that they are helped by another delectable visitor from outer space (Olivia Wilde) spices up the proceedings further.<br>
<br>
However, considering the film boasts of such a stellar star cast (James Bond and Indiana Jones!), you do expect some more fireworks and feel somewhat let down by the lack of chemistry between the lead actors.

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Okay, the franchise had been losing steam, but rejoice, universal hero Harry Potter gets a grand finale with Deathly Hallows Part 2. There's drama, action, terror, danger, death, special effects and loads of magic as the world's three most loved fictional characters meet their final destiny. But what makes the film really special is the high emotional quotient as heroes emerge from nowhere, lovers exchange love and longing neath the shadow of death and friends give a whole new meaning to friendship. Many a times, the film touches your heart and fills your eyes with a strange mistiness... something that rarely happened in the last few encounters.<br>

His crime: he hasn't been to college. So Larry enrolls himself in college and finds a dream teacher in Ms Tainot (Julia Roberts), an embittered, disinterested professor on the brink of a breaking marriage. Is this a perfect set-up for a student-teacher affair?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> We know you'd rush to watch Hollywood's two high premium stars get starry-eyed for each other. But hold it. The passion doesn't actually burn up the screen and the romance is a tad laid-back. Julia is too drunk for most of the time and Tom is too uncomfortable as a preppie.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, there's enough to hold your attention in the film. And that comes mostly from the interesting bunch of students who comprise the college community. The most interesting ones being young and free-spirited Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and the nerdy Steve Dibiasi (Rami Malek). Talia doesn't take time to adopt style-challenged Tom as her pet project and give him the twenty-plus look. She also invites him to join the scooter gang which races through the streets at night. Now this obviously gives Tom's boring life and edge and excitement it has never had. Steve's antics as the joker of the class are pleasant and great fun.<br>

<strong>Story:</strong> A Cybetronian ship is discovered in a wrecked state on the moon by Apollo 11. The Autobots and the Decepticons are in a race to reach the ship and decipher its secrets which include a half dead Transformer and his scientific marvels. Are these marvels human-friendly are or they a threat to the human race? Time for Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) to leap to the rescue.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> There's loads of action, high drama, grandiloquent special effects and yet Transformers 3 isn't as engrossing as the first two parts. And that's only because the films lacks heart -- the high emotional quotient which gave the first two parts its soul and substance behind all the FX.<br>
<br>
This time, it is the machines that tower above man. Both the Autobots and the Decepticons are in flamboyant form, determined to shock and awe with their conflicting motives. While the Decepticons are, as usual, hell bent on creating mayhem on Planet Earth under the guidance of their leader Megatron, the Autobots are unwavering in their allegiance to the human race. The aggressive Optimus Prime and the adorable Bumble Bee faithfully remain Sam Witwicky's faithful foot soldiers, determined to save the world with the young hero who has already done it twice.<br>
<br>
But the most alluring mecha-man is Sentinel Prime, the Autobot who returns from the dead and turns renegade. He is almost majestic despite his evil plans to turn the entire human race into slaves and re-instate the machines as masters of the universe. As he stands on the precipice of a high-rise building and conducts his devastating orchestra, he steals the show and showcases himself as the true master of the game.<br>
<br>
Amongst the human characters, Megan Fox is sorely missed. She added so much visual and visceral appeal as Sam's girl friend that anyone who steps into her shoes would be doomed to be a poor substitute. Can't blame Rosie Huntington-Whitely, can we? Shia LaBeouf is his usual nerdy self: the unlikely hero with the arduous mission to save the world. While Patrick Dempsey adds a new dimension to his acting graph by playing bad: a complete volte-face from the dreamy doctor in Grey's Anatomy. But the most colourful display is put up by John Malkovich as the super rich, somewhat insane machine enthusiast: a complete scene-stealer.<br>
<br>
The film is way too long and could do with some much-needed editing. Specially since most of the fights get repetitive and the drama seems unnecessarily prolonged. That apart, Transformers 3 has enough to make you celebrate the believe-it-or-not spectacle of larger-than-life Hollywood.

<strong>Story:</strong> Not all is well in the Western town of Dirt. Till Rango -- the hero -- sets foot in the town. He of course is out to find friends unlimited, but ends up being the hero. And how...<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Rango is your average friendly neighbourhood guy. He's smart. He's cool and loves sporting Hawaiian shirts. And he wants the world (read his town) to be the perfect place to live in. So what's the problem? First, he is not human; he's a chameleon. Second, his town, Dirt, is full of villains headed by the big bad Mayor, who never lets the town live in peace. Add to this is Dirt's water crisis. And that's exactly what gives Rango a mission and challenge in life.<br>
<br>
But life's never been so simple for heroes. Not even for Rango who predicts the inevitable with his one liner 'A hero can't exist in a vaccum'. For starters, Rango on his way to dream land, falls out of his family car and ends up in the creepy town of Dirt. Then, in his bid to make Dirt a town with plenty of water and love, he ends up running through deserts, chasing weird creatures, narrowly escaping bomb explosions and being swallowed by snakes. This is what makes up for the visual treat in this animation movie. And who are the villains this time? Deadly hawks, poisonous snakes, vicious rattlesnakes, angry vultures, cunning moles... Of course the master is the tortoise, the Mayor, (Beatty).<br>
<br>
So does our hero actually make Dirt dirt-free? Yes, though there's one place where he just doesn't seem to know how to put his heroic acts in place -- his blooming love with Bean (Isla Fisher) -- the dainty, little lizard.<br>
<br>
A treat for kids, some thought-provoking moments for grown ups, Rango is great summer fare. Add to this, Johhny Depp's lively voice over, perfectly matched with some bright, smart, catchy animation...rest assured, there’s enough value for money here.<br>

<strong>Story:</strong> Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is chilling out in the dusty town of Radiator Springs with his buddy, the buck-toothed Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), waiting for the new racing season to begin. When a new challenger, Franscesco Bernoulli (John Turturro) threatens to defeat him in the cross-countries race, McQueen has no option but to accept the challenge and once again prove he is the best car on the race track. Add to this an espionage plot where the bumbling Mater gets embroiled and a fuel rivalry and you have a racy, pacy rollercoaster ride.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>The highpoint of the film are the picturesque locales where McQueen tests his skills on the race track. London, Paris, Tokyo and the exotic countryside of Italy almost dazzle you with Pixar's impeccable animation creating art on screen. Even before you've had your full of glitzy Tokyo, it's time to feast your eyes on Paris, London, Italy... all equally dazzling and bright.<br>
<br>
Then of course, there is the friendship between the somewhat dim-witted but golden-hearted Mater and the spunky McQueen. This time, the relationship hits a rough patch only to regain its vigour and vitality in reinforced measure. Add to this the unlikely romantic angle between the rickety dump truck, Mater and the sprightly British intelligence agent Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) and you have enough sound bytes and sweet little messages on friendship, love, respect and acceptance to carry home.<br>
<br>
The film does get a bit complicated with too much of the espionage plot and the fuel controversy and the focus tends to shift from the races which are the essence of the film. But by and large, Cars 2 is fun for the family and great fun for kids. A confession: Part one was better.

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Now this one's straight out of DC comics. The battles are top notch. The special effects are worth most of the money. And the characters look almost real.

His youngest son Sajid (Aqib Khan), plagued by bullies in school, is growing unruly and rebellious. In order to tame him, George takes him to Pakistan to spend time with his first wife (Ila Arun) and the family he abandoned twenty years ago. But getting back isn't as easy as it seems, specially when his English wife (Linda Bassett) chooses to join him....<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The film is essentially a sequel to East is East, the film that focused on the travails of a Pakistani-British family trying to cope with the cultural divide. But West is West stands on its own, even though it carries forward the story of the man who struggles between his twin identities: George Khan, the Pakistani-Brit who runs a modest eatery and Jehangir Khan, the Pakistani farmer, with family, property and roots in rural Pakistan. And that's because the film carries one simple message that needs to be reiterated, the world over: East may be East, West may be West, but people are the same, despite their superficial differences.<br>
<br>
The highpoint of the film is young Aqib Khan who not only renders a scintillating performance as the pubescent Sajid, but becomes a metaphor for the whole film. Sajid's journey of self discovery, which begins with extreme hate for the dustbowl of Pakistan grows to a gentle fondness for his origins, and becomes the story of each and every character in the film. Acceptance must come from both sides, be it Jehangir Khan's abandoned family or his culturally diverse English family. In a seminal sequence, the two wives manage to communicate despite their language barriers, and touch your heart, while they do it.<br>
<br>
The performances are all impressive, specially by Om Puri and Ila Arun. The humour is delightful. But what finally takes your breath away is the soulful music of the film rendered by the nomadic Sufi Saeen Zahoor. Do stay for the last number, Aik Alif.

The ka-boom stuff is all there, in heavy doses too, but it comes only when the characters have told their story and expounded their reasons to explode. What's more, the film may be a fictional superhero story but it beautifully blends history with superpower histrionics.

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> So is there really a big bad world out there? Yes, at least for 16-year-old Hanna (Saoirse Ronan). She is lonely. She excels in martial arts in the name of self defense. And knows how to give it back each time you mess with her. And the brain behind this raging anger is none other than daddy Erik (Eric Bana) from whom self defense is the best way to protect himself and his daughter. Specially since they're most wanted by Matissa (Cate Blanchett). Reason? Their skills and knowledge are a big threat to Big Brother America. No wonder when the next big thing (read real assignment) comes his way, Hanna is who daddy appoints to do the task. Of course with some advice: There's a big bad world out there. And bad world out there is, for Hanna....<br>
<br>
Cut to the innumerable chase sequence all through Europe, especially when Hanna takes on US soldiers to escape her subterranean jail. Next is a chase between rows of shipping containers, followed by a punch-up between our heroes and some spooks inside a subway. Check out the cinematography brought out through a wide range of opposites -- from woody forests to the dry deserts, from city skyscrapers to snow covered valleys. Of course, adding life to all this is Hanna with many a foe and one friend, many a question on the human psychology/motif (since she has never met anyone before other than her dad) and a series of fast changing emotions....<br>

Trouble brews when Dex reciprocates a similar passion for the staid singleton and the conflict between love and friendship begins.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> If you've seen and savoured Julia Robert's somewhat wicked antics in My Best Friend's Wedding, there would be little reason why you would enjoy this pale copy of the livelier treatise on love versus friendship. Specially since Ginnifer Goodwin is such a washed out version of a girl who is in two minds whether to bother about herself or her friend. Of course, she does have the usual dilemmas when her best friend unwittingly humiliates her and uses her. Also, the fact that Dex follows her around like a devoted puppy and doesn't think twice before having a steamy night out with her, does make her weigh her options often.... But rarely does the fire raging within force her to throw caution to the winds.<br>
<br>
The film proceeds as an unending, over-extended pre-nuptial party, where loyalties are tested and friendships are re-iterated. The threesome insists on hiding their true feelings and desires, so much so, it gets a bit irksome: all this subterfuge! The only person who displays a bit of spark is Kate Hudson who remains realistically me-centric till the very end. For the rest, there's too much schmaltzy sacrifice to keep the drama off sleep mode.

This time, Johnny Depp takes the iconic character and transforms it into a total prankster who sets you smiling with everything he does, or doesn't do. Of special note is his super ability to stay out of trouble... he's hardly in the middle of a fight, assiduously avoids violence, prefers wordplay to swordplay and follows just one line: the least line of resistance. His entire body language, his dialogue rendition and his sassy attitude make him a mesmerizing screen presence. Of course, he's brawny and brave too, but only when the situation desperately demands machismo.<br>
<br>
But Sparrow isn't there alone to hold your interest. There's Penelope Cruz who adds oomph and sparkle as the wannabe nun-turned-vixen, with a wild fire burning within. The flashy chemistry between Cruz and Depp literally makes the screen crackle and hiss. Add to this the colourful bunch of other characters -- Barbosa, Blackbeard, the clergyman, the good and bad mermaids --and you have enough to keep the clock ticking.<br>
<br>
Of course, like the rest of the films in the franchise, this one too could have been shorter and does tend to drag in places. But remember, there's the legendary Jack Sparrow to revv up the drama whenever it slackens. A little low on action, Pirates 4 makes up with its wit and humour.<br>

<strong>Story:</strong> The vampires are back from the land of the dead. Once again, they want to take over the cities and dominate over the human species. They kidnap young Lucy (Lily Collins) and hold her hostage until their devious demands are met. But they underestimated the power of Lucy's dad, the warrior priest (Paul Bettany) who is hell-bent on finally putting an end to the bloodsuckers. The dashing priest is joined in his crusade by a feisty priestess (Maggie Q) and Lucy's boyfriend (Cam Gigandet).<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> It's a dark world, but don't despair. For the screen relentlessly lights up with heavy doses of action as Paul Bettany essays the role of a most unusual priest. Bettany and his holy warriors believe in using the crucifix as a weapon of destruction and kicking butt more than going in for confession. Of course, the church forbids him from trespassing the rules of good conduct, but this guy's the quintessential rebel who knows when it's time for the rosary and when it's time for rolling out the bazookas.<br>
<br>
Bettany is in great form as the maverick man of God. But more than the performances, it is the well-choreographed action sequences that keep you glued to your seats. The high-powered bikes, the tantalizing tango on the top of a speeding train and the sundry encounters with weird forms of evil keep the clock ticking. The 3D effect however is minimal and the dark glasses make the darkness even more pervasive.<br>
<br>
Take a back seat Edward Cullen. The bad bloodsuckers are here, and yes, they wear no lip gloss.

<strong>Movie Review:</strong>The franchise which began on a high note with Fast and Furious and then went off course with the last two sequels (Tokyo Drift, 2 Fast 2 Furious) seems to be back on track in it's fifth version. And there are three reasons why this one works so well.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Artistic period romance</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Story:</strong> Jacob Jankowski (Robert Pattinson), a young veterinary student is forced to abandon his studies after the untimely death of his parents. He hops aboard a circus train in the 1930s and begins to work as a vet. But will he survive, specially when he falls in love with Marlene (Reese Witherspoon), the star performer who happens to be the wife of August (Christoph Waltz), the brutish ring master who believes animals -- and humans -- necessarily need to be dominated. He finds a friend in Rosie, the elephant, who understands only Polish commands and becomes Marlene's star mascot.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> This is arthouse cinema, meant for viewers who are in no rush; rather, they would like to sit back and let a story and its characters grow on you in a leisurely pace, without compromising on mood, period and ambience.<br>
<br>
The film is a movie adaptation of Sara Gruens' best-selling book which lovingly traced the role a gentle pachyderm played in the romance of two star-crossed lovers, against a circus backdrop. While Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon's forbidden affair may be the focus of the story, ironically, the other affair becomes more arresting in the film version. And that's the all-consuming, obsessive, brutal love that Witherspoon's husband, August (Christoph Waltz) harbours for her. Christoph's characterisation of the cruel ringmaster, who operates under a veneer of kindness, is a towering performance and completely steals the show, despite the stellar roles that each and every fringe character plays in the film. Even the animals -- the horses, the elephant, the dog -- are unforgettable, specially the booze-guzzling Rosie with her tattooed trunk that literally talks to you.<br>
<br>
The film is as much an ode to the extravaganza that circuses used to be, as it is an enigmatic, old-fashioned Hollywood romance. More importantly, it is a platform for Pattinson to burst forth from the Twilight zone and prove he is much more than pallid vampire material. He tries hard and almost convinces you....Of course, there's the talented Reese Witherspoon to cover up for his occasional gawkiness, but the winner is Jack Fisk's artistic production design and Christoph Waltz's sadistic ring master act.<br>
<br>
Sit back and savour Hollywood in retro mood.

The rest is history. Mora not only finishes his book, he becomes a financial czar and woos back his girl friend (Abbie Cornish). Will Eddies NZT-odyssey help him to reach limitless heights or will it all catch up: the Russian mafia, the shark-like business tycoon, Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro) or the limited supply of the wonder drug?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Another riveting fantasy, Limitless has Bradley Cooper playing the quintessential loser who gets one helluva chance to clear the cobwebs in his life. Suddenly, with one pop of a pill, the guy who couldn't type a single word on his computer, grows into a best-selling writer, overnight. Not satisfied with that, he pops another pill and decides to get rich. Bloody rich. It doesn't take long before he is dabbling in billions, by playing stock analyst to a shrewd Robert De Niro. He pops some more pills and decides it's time to fly solo -- Senator, Governor, President.... Truly, the sky can be the limit. Unless the mafia catches up, the supply of his wonder drug shrinks or the brain just crumbles like a cookie.<br>
<br>
Limitless is a terrific ride into realms unimagined. Cooper carries you through as he cruises through unexplored, superhero territory and lays bare the limitless terrain that smart and sassy Hollywood is daring to enter. Of course, there is a mention -- a mere mention -- of the dark side of the moon. But that's beside the point.

<strong>Story:</strong> Yogi Bear needs to play crusader once again. This time, it is a question of survival as Jellystone Park, his beautiful wild home, is threatened by a power-hungry politician who wants to be governor at all costs. Even if it means cutting down all the trees, transforming the greens into agricultural land and sacking the eco-friendly Ranger Smith. Can the bumbling bear save his home and the happiness of the city-dwellers? Maybe he can, with best friend Boo-Boo around....<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> He's big, brown, benign and bumbling. Everything that makes Yogi such a big hit. Add to this, his insistence on being smart and city-bred, and you have a recipe for loads of goofy fun. Pay attention to this. Yogi hates to be any old bear. He hates to `forage' in the wilds for food. He hates to catch fish with his paw. And he hates to leave the limelight.<br>
<br>
So what does he love? His favourite pastime is to invent ways and means to steal the pic-a-nic hampers from all the lovely families that throng the park. Only, there's a problem now. The crowds seem to have stopped coming and the city seems to be going bankrupt. Enter, wily politico (Andrew Daly) who wants to decimate the greens for crude cash. Ranger Smith (Tom Cavanagh) tries his best to save the sanctuary with the help of the friendly documentary film maker Rachel (Anna Faris), but Yogi's good interventions always seem to sabotage the plans.<br>
<br>
Doesn't really matter, does it? For Yogi is the quintessential bumbling hero who always does save the day for friends and himself. The film has a lazy and laidback charm and may not be as fast and furious as the current crop of animation films hitting Hollywood's screens.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, the voice-overs of Dan Ackroyd and Justin Timberlake for Yogi and his friend Boo-Boo add vibrancy to the drama and create a film that's a sweet weekend getaway.<br>
<br>
This one's a must for those who have grown up on the much-loved Hanna-Barbera cartoon character. The 3-D may not be integral to the production but there are enough shoves and pushes to keep you ducking in your seat.

<strong>Story:</strong> Small town girl Sarah (Minka Kelly) moves to a college in Los Angeles, chasing her dreams to become a high-profile fashion designer. She finds a friendly roommate in rich girl Rebecca (Leighton Meester) and is all set to find love and a future for herself, until she discovers her roommate’s freaky side: over-friendly, over-possessive, psychotic. But is she dangerous too?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The film is a re-make of Barbet Schroeder’s chilling 1992 thriller, Single White Female which went on to became a cult amongst chick flicks. But don’t compare it with the classic because the jagged edged bonding between Bridget Fonda and the sweetly psychotic Jennifer Jason Leigh is hard to match. Closer home, we have had a recent desi re-make in Jagmohan Mundra’s The Apartment with Tanushree Dutta and Neetu Chandra reprising the roles of the frenemies. You can safely compare The Roommate with this one! It’s better.<br>
<br>
Both Minka Kelly and Leighton Meester are TV stars who make their screen debut with this film and actually don’t fare too badly. If Kelly’s Sara is suitably shy and lonesome as the small towner who tries to fit in with with the cosmo cult, then Beverly Hills brat Meeter’s Rebecca is the enigma we must fathom in due course. The two complement each other well while playing the dangerous cat and mouse game despite the overt bonhomie.<br>
<br>
Of course, it is Rebecca who has a better graph as she moves from BFF (best friend forever) to sinister stalker who can’t have her roomie bonding with anyone else, other than her. Threats and violence is perpetrated against anyone who dares to come between her and her obsession, be it Sara’s offending tutor (Billy Zane), her new love interest (Cam Gigandet) or her set of other friends. Even the pet kitty isn’t spared, nor is her ex-boyfriend.<br>
<br>
The film is a languorous and stylish investigation of a disturbed young mind and creates a character that evokes sympathy rather than distaste. Yes, Rebecca needs help, but she can’t find it in Sara, can she?<br>
<br>
Watch it for the moody pace and for the performances by the two girls.<br>

One that isn't too welcome by the food conglomerates. Add to this a throwback to history where a German spy claims to have done dubious stuff for the Stasi and a mysterious Frank Lagella putting in a hurried cameo in the end, and you might have to make some effort to decipher the going-ons and put the dots together. Also, the on-not-on romance between the exotic Bosnian Taxi driver and the hard-pressed scientist makes you iffy about their relationship.<br><br>What holds the film together is Neeson, a fine actor always, a racy pace and montages of beautifully photographed Berlin.

<strong>Story:</strong> It's been a few years and Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is back in her hometown to promote her new book. Reason enough for THE Ghostface killer to start his killing spree. Time to find out whodunnit... and unveil the mission (read man) behind the mask...<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Prequels... Sequels... Remakes... And now ``reboot'' -- That's the one term used constantly throughout Scream 4 by a new generation of geeky high schoolers who fall prey to the latest whodunnit and who'll-be-the-next-victim thriller in the suburban town of Woodsbro. Yes, it's been a decade since the last Scream title hit theatres, but nothing much seems to have changed for Wes Craven -- the psycho Ghostface still roams around in the white mask-black-robe getup; Ghostface still finds plenty of teeny girls all alone at home during nighttime; and back in town to promote her new self-help book, Sidney Prescott still remains the untouched and unharmed hero of the movie. And that's where the story takes off from...<br>
<br>
Sidney's return for a book signing session to her hometown, Woodsbro, coincides with the anniversary of the original killings. This undoubtedly gives her (and us) a reason to reunite with Ghostface after ten long years, this time as he primarily kills all kids in town. Why just kids, not far from danger are Sidney's best friends (Courtney Cox), the reporter, and Dewey Riley (David Arquette), the sheriff, her last remaining cousin, Jill (Emma Roberts), Aunt Kate (Mary McDonell)... the whole town of Woodsbro. In fact, after the trademark murder right at the start of the film, a lot of time is spent in explaining the who's who. A `reboot' indeed, though we don't really mind meeting the original `scream-agers'!<br>
<br>
So what's new? Fear factor, maybe? Not really, for there isn't a single moment that makes you shifty. There's just more blood, more twists, more special effects, more teen drinking and a continuous use of the word ``reboot''. That's a `rehash' you scream!

It may not be original, but Just Go With It is actually an entertaining watch with a witty screenplay and a quirky chemistry between Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston. Aniston's metamorphosis from be-spectacled, scruffy-haired plain Jane to sexy bikini-clad diva has a charming growth curve, even as Adam Sandler's transformation to husband and daddy material tugs at your heart.

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Now that's a tough choice that Matt Damon must make. Should he opt for the US Presidentship, a goal he has been yearning for ever since his dad took him to listen to a speech by JFK, or should he settle for sweet domesticity with the woman who fills every void in him? Indeed, a difficult decision, specially when the woman he keeps encountering in the streets of New York is the delectable Emily Blunt who dances like a dream.<br>
<br>
The film, based on a Philip K. Dick novel is more of a romance than a sci-fi thriller. The encounters between Damon and Blunt form the spicy core of the film, although the enigmatic men in overcoats who like to re-set brains and ridicule free will, are equally enticing. Their job is to ensure that the world remains and does not perish due to human folly. Hence they criss-cross the world and try to prevent certain people from following impulses that go against the pre-ordained set-up. And yes, they take their orders from a CEO up there!<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The Lincoln Lawyer, a stylish courtroom drama has so much happening, both within the trial room and behind it, it literally keeps you on the edge of your seat.

He is determined to bring back the Eagle, a symbol of the missing Roman Ninth Legion which disappeared after his father's death. He is accompanied by his slave and buddy Esca (Jamie Bell) in this life-threatening expedition.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> If you are still interested in a sword and sandal epic when people fought with naked swords and slim knives, minus all the SFX blitzkrieg and rode horses, rather than hi-tech machines, then The Eagle is your weekend watch. With a landscape that brings back memories of Middle Earth (Lord of the Rings) and heroes who bleed and bay for blood, this one's as traditional as they come. Sadly, it lacks the grandiloquence of The Gladiator, despite its wrestle-and-fist fury and tends to become a long-drawn misadventure in places.<br>
<br>
Also, it may be set in the distant, very distant past, but all that allusion about defending the Eagle and fighting the savages has a pronounced all-American flavour. Unlike Avatar, this one's heavily loaded against the indigenous tribes, who, with their painted faces and their sinister aura, are truly barbaric and prime enemy material.<br>

<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> This one's a Lara Croftish videogame that begins on a high note and then gets a bit repetitive. Sad, because Sucker Punch comes from the people who gave us 300 and yet lacks the visual fest of violence. Babydoll (Emily Browning) is locked against her will by daddy not-so-dearest, reason enough for her to fight for her freedom. And how does she do it? She lets her mind take her -- along with her dare devil stunts -- beyond the boundaries of time, place or capacity. But then things turn complicated when the lines between the real and imaginary blur.<br>
<br>
For the action quotient, there are a bunch of kickass girls engaging in fantasy warfare against everything from Samurais to serpents, interplanetary robots, undead WWI soldiers, cyborgs...

Well, Babydoll involves four other hotties -- the to-do-or-not-to-do Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), the I-don't-give-a-damn Rocket (Jena Malone), the world-at-my-feet Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and the goody-two-shoes Amber (Jamie Chung) -- in her fight against fate and their captors (Oscar Isaac, Carla Gugino and Jon Hamm).<br>

Tien returns to his kingdom to fight the new tyrant (Dan Chupong) who has usurped his throne.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The highpoint of the third and final instalment of the Ong Bak series is supposed to be the `muay kotchasarn' or the elephant boxing, a new martial arts form invented by Tony Jaa, the Thai answer to Bruce Lee. But other than a few leaps and bounds with the loyal pachyderms, there isn't much elephantine action you get to see. In fact, there is some eye-popping brutality that might even interest PETA and inspire them to take it up as their case.<br>
<br>
When Tony Jaa fights, it is indeed fun to watch, specially when he seems to defy all the laws of gravity and transcend all the limitations of the human body. Also, he does find a suitable match in Dan Chupong who plays evil with a relish and stands up to him, blow by blow. But there is such a prolonged health binge in between where Tien undergoes all kinds of therapy, it seems to sap you of your energy.<br>

<strong>Story:</strong> Two brothers move to a new house with their mom (Teri Polo) and discover a gaping hole in their basement. They open it, one random afternoon while fooling around when mom's away and find strange new things coming out of the bottomless pit. Joining them in the chilly excursion is their sweet neighbour (Haley Bennett) who thinks they have just opened the gateway to hell. Is that so...<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Not bad. Considering there's so little happening this week due to the World Cup fever, The Hole is a fun outing for the family. Okay, so it's supposed to be a horror film but don't worry, kids won't get the heebie-jeebies with the scare-you quotient, simply because the protagonists themselves are a bunch of GenYers. And like all young people, brothers Dane (Chris Massoglia) and Lucas (Nathan Gamble) and their sassy neighbour, Julie (Haley Bennett) are suitably bored, in search for thrills in a non-thrilling neighbourhood. Naturally then, their life perks up when they discover a mysterious hole in the basement of their house, which incidentally has had a creepy ex-resident who moved to a dilapidated factory to escape the chill factor.<br>
<br>
Hole, did we say? Let's call it an abyss because there seems to be no end to this tunnel. Anything that goes in -- a torchlight, a toy, a weeping child -- just seems to disappear. And adding an interesting twist to this horror story is the psychological angle, where the director tries to connect the strange apparitions that emerge out of the hole to the hidden fears of the three young people. Young Nathan hates the clown his brother uses to scare him with; Julie has a traumatic accident in the past that she desperately tries to escape; and teenager Dane can't seem to forget an anguished childhood. Is the hole a mirror to their fears? Can it be covered up by surmounting the ghosts within?<br>
<br>
On the goosebump scale, the film has a few moments that might make you grin sheepishly (yup! you almost got scared). But what keeps the drama going is the sweet family theme. Nice brothers, harried single mom (Teri Polo), potential girlfriend: it's sweet, laidback, suburban hustle-bustle, with an add-on: 3-D which pops in intermittently and seems quite unnecessary.<br>

But if you are a purist and don't like re-mixes, specially if they are pallid and lack verve, then you might feel disjointed with Nora and Mary's misadventures in East L.A.<br>
<br>
More importantly, the sisters’ romantic track doesn't roar because the guys aren't hot and happening. Of course, we aren't comparing, but the Edward-Elinor affair isn't classy enough, just as the Marianne-Colonel Brandon relationship isn't as heartwarming as Austen would have wanted it to be. Both Nora and Mary do try and play their parts with sense and sensibility, with Nora essaying the role of the ambitious woman who has no time for love, while Mary prefers to spend her time stocking Prada and seducing her tutor. Of course, there isn't much brand value left in her life after she is forced to move from her mansion in Beverly hills to her more plebeian moorings in downtown Los Angeles. And in case you are wondering what's the Nada bit, it's this: the nothing-of-import upbearing where poor young girls face hell before they can find suitable men. Better be a whore, than die a spinster, declares the pragmatic Mary who has just one mission in life. She wants to move back from Nada to Prada, any which way!<br>

Okay fare.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Semi-horror, semi-Twilight</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Story:</strong> Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) lives in a village in the midst of a dense forest where a dangerous wolf has been on the prowl since long. She doesn't care much about the horror stories and prefers to spend her time romancing the hunky woodcutter, Peter (Shiloh Fernandes) and proposes to run away with him someday. Trouble begins when the wolf kills her sister, her mother insists she marries rich guy Henry (Max Irons) and the wolf hunter, Father Solomon (Gary Oldman) brands her a witch.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Red Riding Hood anyone? Well, there's a wolf, there's a grandmother, there's a woodcutter and there's a pretty girl in a red hood. So far, so good. But if you go looking for a copy book rendition of the Grimm's fairy tale, as in the case of Snow White and Beauty and the Beast, you're obviously mistaken. Again, if you are hoping for a revolutionary adult re-invention of the kiddie story, you're mistaken once more. Because Catherine Hardwicke's reworking of every kid's favourite bedtime story, Red Riding Hood, resurfaces in the Twilight zone: neither a full blown horror flick, nor a contemporary feminist fable. Instead, an oft-seen saga of werewolves and their predilection for spunky maidens.<br>
<br>
Can't blame the director, Catherine Hardwicke, can we? Having made the first instalment in the Twilight series, she still seems to have a hangover about drama that revolves round vampires and werewolves, lusting for pretty young things. But a word of applause here for her protagonist this time round. Valerie is quite unlike Bella Swan and has a delicious appetite for the wicked and the wild. As a little girl, she prefers to break rules, disobey her mother, wander into the forest and hunt rabbits with her childhood friend, Peter. As an adult, she doesn't think twice before taking a tumble in the hay and is more than willing to run away with him to a life of disarray, instead of settling down with the rich and sober Henry.<br>
<br>
Yes, the fun part of this film lies in the characterisation of Valerie as a vixen that ends up as a perfect match to the werewolf who waits patiently for her at the brink of civilisation. Of course the medieval mumbo-jumbo that enters the plot with the arrival of the poorly etched character of Father Solomon does derail the drama. For Red Riding Hood might have ended up as a modern metaphor on feminism (there's a whole lot of spunk 'neath the Hood), but the religiosity reduces the verve.<br>
<br>
Watch it for the excellent production design, the breath-taking cinematography (Mandy Walker) and for Amanda Seyfried's rendition of go-go girls who gotta break some rules. And don't forget to savour Julie Christie's glamorous granny act. Wish there was more of her.

<br>
<strong>Story:</strong> A platoon of American soldiers are called upon to fulfil an unusual mission. They must battle an army of hostile aliens who want to colonise planet Earth. And the battleground is America's golden city: Los Angeles.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Just recently, scientists at NASA seemed to have discovered alien life in the form of microbes. They follow an increasing band of thinkers -- and commoners -- who have begun to believe in the existence of extra-terrestrial life; the most prominent votary amongst them being Stephen Hawking.<br>
<br>
But Hollywood has never been alien territory for the little green guys, nor has it denied the existence of un-earthly planets where Darth Vader and his evil designs may exist.<br>
<br>
So who's causing mayhem this time? Definitely not the cutie from E.T., nor the funny shape-changers from Men in Black. This time, it's a marauding army of mean metallic robotic forms that crowd the screen, mostly in silhouette and sounds. They may have gooey insides, but there's nothing soft about them. They believe in action alone and see no reason to explain their misdeeds in exolanguage or maybe even sign language. The harried human race can only guess why they are here: for our resources; for colonisation, hence the mass annihilation, explains the senior marine while deploying his troops for the counter-attack.<br>
<br>
The film is essentially an uninterrupted string of action cuts where Aaron Eckhart leads the team of American heroes in the high-decibel war against the amorphous invaders. Needless to say, the ugly aliens land on earth in their trademark space ship which may be smaller this time (remember the gargantuan one in Independence Day), but it is heavily loaded with fire power and guzzles up all our water for fuel. Sign of the times? It doesn't take long before glitzy L.A. is reduced to rubble and the death count of hapless civilians and heroic soldiers keeps mounting. Could have been apocalypse, but for the invincibility of the human race....<br>
<br>
Don't go looking for anything that resembles story, characterisation and narrative. You will be disappointed. Just go looking for speed, motion and mayhem and you will have a good time with your munchies. For, Battle: Los Angeles offers you adequate boom for your buck: the basic pre-requisite of an action thriller.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Serious and philosophical look at death and the sense of loss</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Story:</strong> Three people encounter death in different ways and learn to cope with it. Blue collar worker, George (Matt Damon) is a psychic who has the power to communicate with dead people. Journalist Marie (Cecile De France) has a near-death experience during a vacation in Indonesia. School boy Marcus (Frankie Mclaren) loses a dear one and cannot seem to be able to live without him. Their paths intermingle in their search for normalcy and the threesome end up connecting in strange ways.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> When Clint Eastwood makes a movie, you got to sit up and watch. For ever since his early directorial venture, Unforgiven, Eastwood has proved himself to be a storyteller of import. He takes up serious issues and tackles them with a rare sensitivity which stands out in stark contrast to his cowboy cult.<br>
<br>
If the last time you heard him raising a gun against racial discrimination in The Gran Torino, or applauding the leadership of Nelson Mandela in Invictus, this time you hear him out in hushed undertones as he scripts a soft, sensitive and sentimental story about loss and longing. How must humans face the fears of their own mortality and cope with the death of their loved ones: that's Eastwood's million dollar question in Hereafter. More importantly, he tries to explore that great philosophical dilemma: Is there a hereafter; if so, are humans happy out there....<br>
<br>
Eastwood takes up three different stories and smartly blends them together, despite the disparate characters and their diverse settings. Marie, the French journalist travels to London for a book release and ends up meeting the man of her dreams, but only due to the help of a young boy. All the three characters are bound together by a single reality: their encounter with death in different forms. It is the genius of Eastwood which not only manages to seamlessly string the three stories together, but also imbues all of them with depth and gravitas. If Matt Damon lends a refined heroism to his trauma as a psychic who is unable to form normal relationships, then Cecile de France's journey towards self-discovery is equally riveting. But it is the young Mclaren's lonely anguish that enraptures you with its raw poignancy. The boy is simply a delight to watch. A word about the tsunami that strikes in the opening notes of the film: breath-taking!<br>
<br>
Matt Damon has recently been voted as Hollywood's most bankable star. Hereafter shows you why. There's much more to the talented Mr Damon than his Bourne identity. And there's a loftiness to Clint Eastwood's cinema too. Watch it.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Serious inspirational drama which won four Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor (Colin Firth), Best Director and Best Original Screenplay</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Story:</strong> When Prince Albert (Colin Firth) was called upon to lead the British Empire which comprised almost a quarter of the world in the 1930s, he was unsure whether he could be able to play his role as King George VI. This was primarily due to his awkward stammer which prevented him from delivering the public speeches which were required of him in the changing world order.<br>
<br>
Would he be able to give the most important public broadcast which would justify England's war against Germany? Would his unconventional speech therapist, the failed Australian actor, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) cure him of his disability before D-day?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The King's Speech deserves all the accolades it won at the Oscars. First, because it is a highly motivational tale of failure and achievement and the singular ability of man to overcome all his limitations with courage and grit. The journey of Prince Albert from a low-on-confidence, self-censorious and stammering B-B-Bertie to King George VI, a leader of the largest nation, is essentially a universal story of struggle and success. It holds many an aspirational lesson for any and everybody who wants to bridge the gap between Being and Nothingness. The King's relentless efforts to conquer his disability and his therapist's consistent motivation are the stuff great endeavours are made of.<br>

<br>
<strong>Story:</strong> Ballerina Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) gets the chance of a lifetime when she replaces the aging star (Winona Ryder) as the lead dancer in a new rendition of Swan Lake. But there is a hitch. The maverick director, Thomas (Vincent Cassil) wants to cast her both as the virginal White Swan and the evil Black Swan in his visceral production. Will the obsessive artist be able to break the binds of a constricted upbringing and dig out the darker sides in her psyche to play the two roles to perfection or will she succumb to the pressures?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> She may have lost 20 pounds for the role and look intensely fragile, but Natalie Portman is a towering inferno as Nina, the pretty and paranoid ballerina who storms the New York stage like never before. And it isn't the stage alone that becomes a playground for her stormy passions. Backstage too becomes a battleground where illusion and reality blend in horrific measure to create a dark and terrifying concoction of human emotions.<br>

But what if the wives (Christina Applegate and Jenna Fischer) give themselves a hall pass too? Trouble in paradise.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The Farrelly brothers are back, but minus their fangs. Their trademark toilet humour which made films like There's Something About Mary and Stuck On You hearty laugh riots, does remain, but in a diluted form. The bumbling misadventures of the two husbands who are desperate for a bit on the side don't exactly set the screen on a hormonal rage. Nor does it have you rolling in the aisles. Both Owen and Jason make clumsy attempts to be unfaithful to their spouses who seem to be having a much better time, playing wild.<br>
<br>
The brothers Farrelly can't seem to decide whether their heroes are cads or cool guys. And therein lies the problem with Hall Pass. It ain't funny. It ain't serious. Just somewhere in between.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Serious war adventure</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Story:</strong> The film is based on a novel ``The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom'' written by Slavomir Rawiez. It traces the gruelling journey of a bunch of war prisoners who try to flee from a Siberian gulag to escape the wrath of Stalinism.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Early on in the film, Stalin's soldiers tell the prisoners they are in a unique prison which has no walls, no barbed wires, no boundaries.... Simply because they are not needed, because Nature is the wary sentinel in this extreme environment. No fugitive would be able to survive the harsh Siberian winter, believe the guards. It takes almost two and a half hours to prove them wrong as some of our brave hearts not only manage a successful prison break, they even survive the brutality of nature which keeps mutating its monstrous forms: from the extreme Siberian winter to the arid, impenetrable waste of the Gobi desert followed by the dangerous trek over the Himalayas.<br>
<br>
The year-long journey is truly a test of human endurance, as only the fittest survive till the bitter end. And fittest, in Peter Weir's vision doesn't necessarily mean the physically strong and hardy. Instead, it has more to do with moral and emotional vigour in a trek that ends up testing the soul more than the body. When survival is at stake, anybody can live on uneatable stuff like snakes, slugs, caterpillars and maybe cannibalism too. But how many will hang on to humanity and high values?<pi><br>
<br>
The film lives through the sentiments that Weir showcases. The odd assortment of individuals stick to each other, fend for each other and stand up for each other till the very end. Of course Nature does claim its victims and just three of them manage to cross the Himalayas and reach India. But the journey essentially remains a testament of togetherness, team spirit and valour.<br>
<br>
Weir's film is gripping, despite being long and plodding in places. The film has been shot in locations in Bulgaria, Morocco and India and recreates the treacherous terrain with great detail. Of course India strikes a cheerful note as the friendly Indian officials and locals literally welcome the escaped convicts with open arms, officialdom be damned. No passports, no worry, smiles the portly Indian officer and sends them into the village with a flourish. Indian hospitality goes global, huh!<br>
<br>
Weir's films may not be mainstream, but they have a flavour that suitably engages the serious film buff. The Way Back is a gripping watch.</pi>

She hires Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), the toughest US Marshall she can find in cowboy country (Oklahoma in the 19th century) and sets out on a dangerous mission. But will the over-age, reluctant hero actually prove he has true grit and will their seemingly disinterested accomplice, the Texan ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), prove to be the good Samaritan too? Mattie's arduous trek will furnish some startling answers.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Not so long ago, Quentin Tarantino declared that revenge was a dish best served cold and dished out the delectable vendetta epic, Kill Bill. It's time for a revision as the Coen brothers prove that revenge is a dish best served hot. Watch hot-blooded, hot-headed and headstrong Mattie pick up the gauntlet of revenge and insist on avenging her father's death with an acumen that far belies her tender age and you'll begin to wonder who has true grit. Is it the disheveled, drunken, going-downhill Marshall Cogburn who couldn't care less about the motive and the mission? Is it the Texan ranger LaBoeuf who would love to give the cheeky girl a good spanking (and that, he does) and keeps making a guest appearance in the treacherous trek? Or is it the teenage girl who does it all -- bargains, pleads, threatens, gets trigger-happy too -- to keep the momentum on?<br>
<br>
Truly, with True Grit the Coen brothers not only revisit the Western once again, they even re-invent the revenge drama by creating both memorable characters and a mesmerizing mood. The film may be a re-make of the 1969 film which grabbed an Oscar for John Wayne, but the Coen Brothers have added their own signature style to it. Jeff Bridges has rendered an Oscar worthy rendition of Rooster Cogburn who hides a heart of gold beneath a rough exterior. And young Hailee Steinfeld is stupendous as the doughty young teenager who crackles like fire, never loses spunk and holds her own in dangerous territory. Matt Damon provides able support as the iffy hero who always manages to pop as savior and good friend. But more than all this, it is the gritty narrative and the purist style that pulls you towards this old-fashioned tale of old-fashioned valour.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> A story of two half-brothers who try to create history in the boxing ring, the film is based on a real life story of Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) who wants to rise above his status of a brawler: a boxer who is used as a stepping stone to set up a fight with better boxers. He tries to pry himself away from his dysfunctional family with the help of his girlfriend Charlene (Amy Adams), but can't cut ties from his junkie brother cum trainer, Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale).<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The film isn't another Rocky, even as Micky and Dicky are no superstars in the ring. The power of The Fighter lies more in its moving story about family pressures and family bonding than the histrionics in the boxing ring. Of course there is all the mandatory blood-letting and the unpredictable last minute victories that make all films on boxing a thrilling watch. But watching Micky win and lose isn't the highpoint of this film. Watching him try to fight and fit into his demanding, obsessive and edgy family is truly enthralling. Much as he wants, Micky can never turn his back to the hell-raisers who may not be having the best intentions.... Or so Micky thinks, specially when his protective and nurturing girlfriend tries to present a whole new perspective.<br>

But death isn't the only problem facing our super hero. He is bothered by a bunch of school bullies too and must grapple with a complicated love affair with an earthling (Dianna Agron) before he can think about the larger mission in his alien existence.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> For a minute you might think you are watching another film from the Twilight series. In fact, even the lead pair, Alex Pettyfer and Dianna Agron, almost look like Cullen and Bella clones. The setting too is a school where the supra-normal hero must learn to blend in with the normal guys who can be mean and malevolent to newbies and not-so-normal people.<br>
<br>
But you got to shake yourself out of the illusion...or just let it be. I Am Number Four works any which way, either as a Twilight clone or as just another super hero story. It has all the requisites of a normal action hero flick: high testosterone duels, weird creatures that metamorphose into strange and bloodthirsty creatures at the drop of a hat, a special pet (John's puppy) who ends up as the hero's guardian angel, a mission that's running out of time and a hero who has special gifts. So what's Number Four got that you and me don't possess? Palms that throw light and have infinite might and an anti-gravity drive that helps him to dive and save his girl when she drops into nowhere.<br>

More importantly, how does she know who is Mr Right?<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Foxed about the title? Don't be. It's elementary, actually. So, how do you know when you really love somebody? Again elementary, as Owen Wilson finds out. Despite his awkward ways and his I-me-myself attitude, he can't wait to get Reese back into his life, each time she walks away. Or as Paul Rudd discovers, as he endlessly waits for the woman of his dreams on the bus stop, even though she may or may not come. It's only Reese who is somewhat confused between the two rich men who woo her differently. And we are wondering too....Not about the film. That's all fine, flippant, frothy and fun. Like all rom-coms are. And like Reese Witherspoon always is: immensely entertaining and quite whacko.<br>

But what we are wondering about is the presence-non-presence of Jack Nicholson. You can't have an actor like Nicholson and relegate him to two-and-a-half scenes of sweet nothings. Unforgivable.<br>

Would the grieving parents get a second chance on love, life and togetherness? Tough question....<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The film may have a predictable plot, but the performances and screenplay make it an elegant study on grief and its corrosive effects on the human psyche. Coping with bereavement is always tough for humans; The Rabbit Hole shows exactly how tough it can be. While Nicole Kidman spends endless empty days trying to erase the fingerprints (read memories) of her departed son, Aaron Eckhart surreptitiously watches happy and half-forgotten videos of his boy on his cellphone or desperately seeks succour with clandestine pot-smoking sessions with a similar victim.<br>
<br>
The estrangement of the couple is dealt with sensitivity and stark realism. Nicole persistently fobs off her husband's attempts to rebuild the relationship, despite the strong undercurrents of love. Eckhart, on his part, cuts a lonely figure as a man on the edge. But the most poignant relationship in this complex and compelling picture of pain is the fragile bond between the grieving mother and the teenager, Jason (Miles Teller) who accidentally killed her son. Teller's awkward 17-year-old act is intensely moving, as he tries his best apologise and make amends for a deed that can never be written off. The intermittent meetings and discourses on the existence of parallel universes between Nicole and Teller are truly the highpoint of the film.<br>

<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> This 1972 (Mechanic) remake once again reiterates the job of a mechanic -- Do what a mechanic does with perfection even if it means killing someone. And kill, this mechanic, Arthur (Jason Statham) does with style and panache. Not to miss out, the perfect timing, perfect scenic beauty, perfect murder and perfect attitude -- each murder calls for some music on Arthur's good 'ol gramophone. Even when it comes to the job of our mechanic, there's variety. Sometimes it's projected as ``an accident'', sometimes in a way that ``others become suspects'' and sometimes ``to clearly send the message of ``who-dunnit-why-dunnit''.<br>
<br>
Brimming with action, bombs, blasts, babes, guns, cutting-edge techniques, what's-next moments... The Mechanic has enough to pump your adrenalin levels. Statham's Arthur is quintessential Statham: a man of few words and more action, and always invincible as he ducks and deals out death with cold precision.<br>

The devil is active today... Don't talk of the devil for it brings bad things home... Yes, almost forty minutes into the movie and you get to witness the first scary scene. And scared are we? Not really, except for a couple of scenes when the American seminary student, Michael Kovak (Colin O'Donogue) is attacked by the possessed or when he talks to his already-six-hours-dead dad over the phone. For the rest, it's all about Michael questioning the existence of the devil, aliens, God, sin, religion.<br>

Despite fighting a class war and sharing a few popsicle moments in their flight from a national park in Idaho to the minus-human wilds, the wolves don't have too much of a story to tell. Also, there's hardly anything to justify the 3-D tag. Actually all this 3-D business is getting quite tiresome, what with stained, heavy and headachy goggles, pressing down your nose for no reason at all.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Ali (Christina Aguilera), a small town girl with big city dreams, throws off her waitress' attire and hops onto a bus from Iowa to Los Angeles. It doesn't take her long to end up in the Burlesque Lounge, a dance bar that's fallen upon bad days. The owner, Tess (Cher) must find a new talent to fill up the empty chairs so that she can pay her mortgage and send back the land sharks who are ready to prey upon her. Her saviour? Ali, the horse-powered crooner who not only energises the song-dance ensemble but also manages to keep the Burlesque family together.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Watch it for Cher and Christina Aguilera. Between the two of them, they create magical mayhem with songs that have become itune anthems: Welcome to Burlesque, But I'm A Good Girl, You Haven't Seen the Last of Me, Express, Bound to You...numbers that remain with you long after curtain call.<br>
<br>
Watch it for the atmospherics. The Burlesque Lounge may be in sin city but it is innocent and pure, with its gentle peek-a-boo of skin in gossamer and its mildly suggestive gestures and lyrics. No dirty business here, for a bunch of bartenders and girls who merely want to make a decent living. And yes, they do marry the guy if they get pregnant. But most importantly, they live and fight like one big happy family which keeps its troubles to itself and fights back fiercely against a disruptive world.<br>
<br>
It may have a predictable plot and a done-to-death drama, but Burlesque keeps you attentive with its colours, cadence and canvas. Not forgetting both Cher and Christina who perfectly slip into the shoes of the doyen and the diva.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> The film is based on the real-life adventure of Aron Ralston, as documented in the book Between A Rock And A Hard Place. The extreme biker and climber met with a freak accident in 2003 when his hand got trapped under a boulder during a climbing expedition in Utah. The mountaineer spent five gruelling days all by himself in this life-threatening situation before he could extricate himself and reach out for help.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> He may have been married for ten long years but Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) is still at war with father-in-law Jack (Robert DeNiro). He still has to prove he is worthy son-in-law material to a parent-in-law who is suspicious of his affiliations with the pretty colleague, Jessica Alba and wouldn't think twice before finding another husband for his daughter. So what if it happens to be a whacko Owen Wilson who quotes Buddha and Jesus Christ and doesn't like anybody making digs on Deepak Chopra.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The Focker franchise which was such a rib-tickler in its earlier versions does seem to have lost some of its fun in the third sequel. Not only does the bond between Ben and Bob (Robert DeNiro) seem stilted, even Jessica Alba and Owen Wilson can't add fire to the proceedings with their `third angle' avatar. Alba tries hard to play seductress and wean Stiller away from his staid marriage, even as Owen tattoos his back with the portrait of Stiller's wife. But there's nothing much happening in the comedy department: the mainstay of the Meet the Parents franchise. Ostensibly, it's the little Focker's (Stiller's twins) who are supposed to bring the family together. But these kids aren't buoyant enough to add punch to the drama.<br>
<br>
Sad to see how Robert DeNiro has slipped....Does the Godfather really need to find a GodFocker?

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Nicholas Cage, a 14th century crusader takes on a different mission. He must escort a young girl, branded as a witch, to a distant abbey for a trial. The Church believes she is responsible for the Black Plague which has devasted the land. Is Nicholas Cage on the right mission?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> There is too much mumbo-jumbo and old-fashioned tantra-mantra in The Season of The Witch to engage the modern mindset. Unless you think the tale of a bunch of holier-than-thou knights flexing their swords and their incantations against a pretty young thing makes for compelling viewing. The only time you actually sit up is when the hapless young girl dons all her Satanic avatars and keeps changing fiendish forms.<br>
<br>
Once again, you wonder why Nicholas Cage, like Robert De Niro, needs to dabble with so much pulp.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Rapunzel escapes from her turret after being held captive for years by the wicked Mother Gothel, only to discover she is a princess. More importantly, she finds love in the outside world as the bandit, Flynn Rider introduces her to a whole new clime of song and dance. Will her wicked abductor let go....<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>The familiar fairy tale literally lights up the screen through Disney's colourful palette. Rapunzel's 70-feet long golden braid isn't the only magical element in this vibrant animation feature which retells the happily-ever-after fable. There is Flynn Rider's dashing machismo, Mother Gothel's delightful evil and Rapunzel's feisty teen spirit to give you all your money's worth. And if that's not enough, there are the antics of Pascal, Rapunzel's adorable chameleon companion and Maximus, the steed with attitude who make the kids -- and you too -- put our hands together for a handsome applause.<br>
<br>
But more than all this is the state-of-the-art 3-D which transforms the fairy tale into an eye-popping story. Go get your fill, with friends and family.
