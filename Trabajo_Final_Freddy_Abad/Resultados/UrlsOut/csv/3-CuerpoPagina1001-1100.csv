"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Austrian fashionista, Bruno wants to become world famous. And the only way he can do so is by becoming famous in America. He travels to Los Angeles and tries any and everything to grab headlines, even an attempt to turn straight from gay...<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>Not so long ago, it was the Kazhakistan simpleton, Borat who had you in splits with his exploits in America. This time, it's the Austrian, Bruno who gives you some risque rocking moments as he chases his dreams -- once again in the USA -- to become the biggest German superstar, after Hitler! And like Borat, this one too is wild and wicked, poking fun at any and everything that's making news in the celeb obsessed world that throbs in the brightly lit boulevards of LA.<br>
<br>
So, you have Bruno auditioning in the sundry studios of Hollywood to make it big as a film or TV star. As he himself says, he wants to be the biggest 'gay hero after Arnold Schwarzeneggar.' Ha! But despite displaying all his bigness, he doesn't get a break. So, he chooses to go the Brangelina-Madonna way and begins to look for causes. Global warming is too iffy. Everyone's already supporting Darfur, and there isn't any<br>
Dar-five, he opines and opts for orchestrating peace in the Middle East. He does manage to bring the Israelis and the Palestinians on the negotiating table but gets totally confused between Hamas and humus. What's next? `Black gold' from Africa, he exults and ends up adopting a baby who is summarily snatched from him when the Child Welfare department discovers the toddler is a jolly by-stander at Bruno's adult parties. Eventually, there's only one way to get famous: get straight. And Bruno tries some pulpit talk too. But you'll really have to watch the film to watch if it works...<br>
<br>
The film may not be as uproarious as Borat: Cultural Learnings of America to Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, but it does give you some rollicking moments with Sacha Baron Cohen unleashing his manic energy once again. Enjoy, the adult way.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> The film is a biopic on the life and times of Michael Jerome Oher, the American footballer who played for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League. Oher's story is essentially an inspiring tale of racist harmony, where a Memphis high society white woman, Leigh<br>
Ann Tuohy, picked up a homeless, hungry and lonely Oher from the streets and brought him into her home, her heart and her family. The rest is history...She not only sent the black boy to college, but ensured he found a place amongst America's foot balling heroes.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> For all those who have been bothered by the racist overtones of Avatar, The Blind Side might be even more provocative. Because, here is a story that completely reiterates the myth of the white man -- and woman -- being the saviour of the impoverished, crime-infested, driftless black community. In fact, the film even has one of the characters pitching this paramount question to the benevolent Mrs Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) who wants to legally adopt the abandoned black boy, Big Mikey (Quinton Aaron). So, is this something to do with white guilt, huh? Needless to say, the lady brushes aside this uncomfortable question with a `shame on you!'.<br>
<br>
Whether The Blind Side has racist overtones is debatable and left for the theorists. As a piece of cinema, the film works and works quite well, providing Sandra Bullock a role that got her her first Golden Globe and might just end up getting her the Oscar too. As Leigh Tuohy, she's compelling and riveting with her firm resolve to provide a better life for the emotionally challenged 18-year-old who has been on the roads, ever since his mother became a junkie and his father abandoned the family of eight siblings. Needless to say, she's the head of her family too and undoubtedly wears the pants, putting everyone and everything in place, albeit with the support and love of her husband who believes she's truly the best.<br>
<br>
Watch Bullock mother the teen who is twice her size, read him bedtime stories of Ferdinand, the gentle giant bull, teach him how to tackle his opponents on the football field and see how she bullies all and sundry, for the well-being of her extended family...Truly, a power-packed performance that makes you sit up and cheer for this erstwhile cheerleader.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>A serial killer makes his kill in the guise of a stepfather who breaks the stereotype with his seeming goodness. This time, he infiltrates the family of a divorced mother of three by pretending to be in love with her. But before he can execute his evil plan, he must contend with her teenage son who has just returned from military school.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The Stepfather may have a run-of-the-mill story of a scheming psychopath who cleans up entire families to the soundtrack of Silent Night, but there are enough edgy sequences to keep you glued to your seats. So what if you are always one step ahead of the proceedings, you do get your thrills and chills with every creak in the wood, every jump cut, every surreptitious move as step dad David meticulously plans his murders.<br>
<br>
And what's really paisa vasool is the picture of perfection he tries to paint to hoodwink the new gullible family he meets in the mall. At cosy family dinners, he tries to overwhelm them with little sermons on the importance of family, while at night he carries on his mean business in the basement. And anybody who dares to come in his way is conveniently done away with, be it the inquisitive neighbour who discovers on the internet that he actually looks like someone on America's Most Wanted list. Or the real daddy who dares to delve into his antecedents and must necessarily end up in the cold storage.<br>
<br>
For those who like to keep their popcorn crunchy, The Stepfather is adequate time-pass.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Max, an imaginative tween, isn't too happy at home. Nobody, neither his teen sister nor his single mother, seem to have the time for him. On one such lonely night, having been punished by his mom, he conjures up a friendly world, peopled by friendly wild creatures...<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie review:</strong> Can we make this mandatory viewing please for a generation of digi-kids who seem to have forgotten the outdoors completely in their obsession with all things tech? Young Max and his wild musings might just be the perfect antidote for Wii kids who are being insidiously weaned away from all things bright and beautiful, all creatures great and small....<br>
<br>
Based on Maurice Sendak's 1963 kid's classic which reportedly had just nine sentences, the film is a visual parable on the importance of love, creativity, imagination, family, warmth -- and the wild outdoors -- for a wholesome childhood. Stuff that you can hardly dream of getting from your play station, the iPod, MySpace, malls, MacDonalds or mobiles.<br>
<br>
Feeling somewhat neglected by his family, young Max throws a tantrum when his mum's boyfriend stops over for dinner. An angry mom sends him off to bed without dinner and the rest is a riot of imagination. Max runs away on a tiny boat to an island inhabited by strange, oversized creatures. He declares himself king and builds a surrogate family where everybody sleeps in `a real pile'. But soon familial differences set in here too and Max begins to miss his real family. However, he can't return before he sets things right in his newfound kingdom, can he?<br>
<br>
This one's truly for family viewing, specially if you have digi-kids.

<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> This one's actually a zany little comedy that packs in so much fun, it makes you literally squeal in places. Of course, you begin expecting a run-of-the-mill C-grade Hollywood horror flick, but soon realise there's more bang for your buck in these crazy encounters with post mad cow disease humans who `have the munchies' and just love to sink their teeth in a `manwich'.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> A montage of 10 episodic stories, the film was designed as a tribute to the spirit of New York after 9/11. Each episode has been shot by a different director over a period of two days and is eight-minute long.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> So what's your favourite New Yorkism? Multi-culturalism, pub culture, smoking on the side-walks, friendly cabbie rides, night-outs with strangers, no-strings-attached sensual encounters, absolute anonymity, endless opportunity, Broadway binging, Central Park strolling, skyscraper gazing, Fifth Avenue ambling, Brooklyn Bridging, Village hopping, day dreaming, night riding....New York, I Love You offers you all this and so much more; sometimes through a vibrant palette of deft strokes and succinct characters and sometimes in somewhat pallid form. Truly, this brain child of producer Emmanuel Benbihy who began with the Parisian ode, Paris Je t'Aime and proposes to make similar `I Love You' films on Rio, Shanghai, Mumbai and Jerusalem, is a mixed bag. Understandably, everyone is going to have their personal favourites.<br>
<br>
But the one that truly stand out is Shekhar Kapoor's enigmatic little analysis of suicide and the city, where Julie Christie, an erstwhile opera singer, checks in on the top floor of her favourite Manhattan hotel and encounters a friendly bellhop, Shia LaBeouf. The film, written by the late Anthony Minghella, is sheer visual poetry, with its white interiors and its hazy outlines. Both Shia and Christie are riveting.<br>
<br>
The two other stunners include Brett Ratner's funky coming-of-age prom night date story between high schooler Anton Yelchin and teenage method actress Olivia Thirlby and Joshua Marston's tribute to growing old in Manhattan. In this delightful eight-minute feature, a wizened Eli Wallach and his elderly wife Cloris Leachman celebrate their 63rd marriage anniversary on Coney Island, like every other year. Thank God, for the warmth of familiarity.<br>
<br>
There are some more alluring moments in Mira Nair's multi-cultural encounter between the orthodox Jewish woman Natalie Portman and Irrfan Khan, her business associate and Yvan Attal's dekko into the underpinnings of sex and the city with Ethan Hawke trying his best to seduce stranger, Maggie Q. Delicious.<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> There's something about Jackie Chan. Something sweet and sincere that makes him eminently watchable even though he remains deadpan for most parts of his films and his action cuts follow a similar let's-defy-gravity ring to them. Nevertheless, he strikes an instant chord as the entertainer with a zing.<br>
<br>
Here, you are willing to watch him play mommy -- and daddy -- to three kids, teaching them how to tackle the usual business of life: school, dating, bullying, bedtime and sibling strife. But he promises more than a domesticated Chan. For, when he's not singing Chinese lullabies to the little one or tutoring the 10 year-old geek on girls, he's doing his usual thing. Like, swinging across precipices, sliding down escalators, kick boxing the unknown assailant as he tries to save his newfound family from a bunch of Russian terrorists who have discovered a new bacteria that will eat up all the oil in the world. Chan must not only save the kids, he must save the world's oil too, as also his endangered romance with the kid's pretty mommy who's livid with him after she learns he's not just the nice guy next door.<br>
<br>
Nothing original and not quite quintessential Chan -- the action here is muted -- this one's only for diehard Jackie buffs.

<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>Ms Bridget Jones steps down a bit and tries her hand at a typical Hollywood horror flick. But don't be disappointed, for this one does manage to keep you in your seats, despite the no-hype, no-marketing blip surrounding it. Of course, most of the credit must go to young Ms Jodelle Ferland who pitches in a startling performance of the archetypal child-demon. As the sweet yet satanic young girl who speaks politely, smiles adoringly and poses completely vulnerable, she's almost the female avatar of Damien, the devil-boy who scared your wits out in Omen.<br>
<br>
Zellweger saves the helpless girl from her parents while they were trying to bake her in the oven and brings her home, despite insisting she ain't mommy material. It doesn't take long for her to discover her maternal instincts, but before they can actually come into play, it's time to put the brakes. Her best friend and child psychologist, Doug (Bradley Cooper), dies a mysterious death after a frightening session with her young ward; another young boy who comes in contact with little Lillith ruthlessly hacks his parents while they slept. The idyll is short lived as the sinister begins to take a hold over the social worker's life. But is there really a way out? Can she fight the evil that has entered her house and her life? Is Case 39 actually cruel to children?<br>
<br>
May be yes. But that's another debatable question altogether. As a film, Case 39 does work at the simple, basic level of a thriller that thrills. Although Ms Zellweger does look somewhat jaded and whispers a bit too much to create her characteristic impact.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>New Yorkers, Meryl and Paul Morgan are separated and on the verge of a divorce, until they witness a murder and enter the witness relocation programme. Sent off to distant and desolate Wyoming, they have a chance to rediscover each other again.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>The last we saw Hugh Grant was as the immensely lovable crooner in Music and Lyrics. And the last we saw Sarah Jessica Parker was as the archetypal New Yorker in Sex and the City. Do we want to see this seemingly odd couple together in this romcom that really doesn't have anything new to offer? Well, okay, if you must....Totally time-pass.<br>
<br>
The only novelty about this jaded script about a squabbling uptown couple who fall back in love is the emergence of a brand new character on Hollywood's screen. Say hello to Sarah Palin as she dons her celluloid avtar as Emma, the gun-toting wife (Mary Steenburgen) of a US marshall who has been assigned the job of protecting the Morgans as they enter a witness relocation programme to evade an assassin who's been chasing them from New York. Like Palin, Emma too is a hard-boiled carnivore who lives in the wilds, isn't intimidated by grizzlies and other wild animals and loves a mean hunt, while flashing her loaded gun and leather boots. And in case you miss the similarities, there's Mrs Morgan who exclaims 'Oh my God, that's Sarah Palin!' when she first spots her. It's here, in wild and laid back Wyoming that the Morgans get a chance to shed their big city blues and discover the joys of giving and loving...Like, sharing quiet dinners in candle light or battling bears in the backyard.<br>
<br>
The film does have a tired Hugh Grant and a washed out Sarah Jessica Parker trying to be funny. To be fair, they do manage to make you smile, now and then, while the popcorn lasts.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Micah and Katie may have moved into their new house in San Diego, but their bliss is short-lived. The couple discover a paranormal presence in their house and try to combat it with a set of video cameras and some common sense.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The low budget film ($15,000) has reportedly sent the world into a screaming frenzy despite its grainy look and its hand-held camera, home video kind of footage. Viewers have likened its shock and awe effects to The Blair Witch Project, with theatres in the US recording a communal frenzy of `oohs' and `aahs' in packed late night shows.<br>
<br>
Guess we Indians are a braver lot. Didn't really feel the chill, except in one or two sequences to be honest. But more than the leap-out-of-your-seat factor, it's the sheer experimental quality of the film that needs to be savoured and saluted. Shot entirely with a hand-held camera and featuring just two people for most of the screen time, the film manages to hold your attention in an age when cinema has donned a whole new `Avtar'. Even the horror is mostly imagined, minus all special effects that generally form the core of hardcore horror films like The Exorcist. This one's more in league with Rosemary's Baby where you feel the chill without ever seeing the scare factor.<br>
<br>
Micah tries his best to battle the unseen presence that has been following Katie ever since she was eight-years old. He buys an Ouija Board to communicate with the Thing, sprinkles powder on the floor to capture his footprints, sets up umpteen video cameras all over the house and keeps the bedroom door ajar. The couple even calls in a demonologist to give them some sane, scientific or spiritual advice. But nothing does seem to work. The bed does keep creaking at night, the stairways shake with loud thumping noises, the door shuts and opens on its own accord, the sheets get crumpled, heavy breathing fills the air and Katie begins to bruise....<br>
<br>
Catch the night show if you actually want to feel the heebie-jeebies. And don't go looking for long-winded explanations. You might end up blaming the chill, not on winter alone.<br>
<br>
A word about:<br>
<br>
Performances: Both Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat are naturals. Can't tell whether they are actually acting.<br>
<br>
Screenplay: Director Oren Peli has done the screenplay too and keeps it completely true to life. Could be happening to you and me, all this weird stuff. Phew!<br>
<br>
Cinematography: Jerky, grainy, hand-held and completely effective. Inspires you to pick up your video-cam too for stuff that transcends the family video scene.<br>

<br>
<strong>Movie review: </strong>Some lucky girl, this Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart)! On the one hand, she manages to find the wildest boyfriends for sure: If it isn't the ashen-white and absolutely ravishing vampire, Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), baring his fangs for her, it's the eight-pack were-wolf, Jacob (Taylor Lautner) feverishly grinding his teeth or wolfishly blinking his eyes for her. And on the other, she manages to stay away from all the banal humans who can't even handle the adrenalin rush of an in-your-face action film. More importantly, humans hardly make ideal boyfriends in an age when it's easy to end up as Tiger(s) in the Wood(s).<br>

Tinker Bell has broken the fragile moonstone and failed in a task that might not bring back the Pixie Dust Tree: the source of all their magic. She must make amends with the help of her best friend Terence before the elders get to know...<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie review: </strong>Disney still draws the line when it comes to animation, despite the surge of other production houses like Pixar and Dreamworks. The colours and the characters of Tinker Bell create a living-breathing canvas that's pure art. More importantly, the film is a must-learn lesson for Indian animators who need to take the big leap in this growing field.<br>
<br>
This one's an archetypal fairy tale that gladdens the heart of kids and adults alike. Tinker, with her strapless green dress, her gossamer wings and her golden bun is a fiery little fairy who literally sees red when she loses her cool. And she does loose it quite often. So much so, she even manages to break the fragile and precious moonstone in a fit of fury.<br>
<br>
She's mad at her best buddy Terence, the caretaker of the all-important pixie dust, for his meddlesome ways, even though Terence was simply trying to help her build the sceptre. This was a task assigned to her by the fairy queen and had to be completed before the Harvest Moon, if Pixie Hollow is to be saved.<br>
<br>
With the moonstone shattered, antsy Tinker has just one option. She must fly across Neverland on a dandelion to find the magical mirror that will grant her a wish. But before she crosses the treacherous terrain, she must decide which is the real treasure: the Mirror of Incanta or her friendship with Terence.<br>
<br>
This one's a perfect outing for the kids who will have a ball watching the pesky Trolls, taking the 21 butterfly salute or savouring the Fairy Tale Theatre orchestra made up of croaking frogs and chirping crickets.<br>
<br>
Correction: Interestingly, we have learnt that the animation of Tinker Bell has been done in India. Kudos to the talented army of Indian animators behind this artistic work. Sadly, this fact should have been advertised upfront in the Disney marketing strategy of the film for the India release. When we say Tinker Bell should be a lesson for Indian animators, we mean all those people who are assiduously trying to promote Indian animation films as a separate, viable and vibrant genre of popular Indian cinema. Apologies if the comment has hurt our talented artists who have ventured bravely into a new world.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Catherine Zeta-Jones, a 40-year-old single mom with two kids, desperately needs a nanny. She finds one in Justin Bartha, the 24-year-old coffee shop assistant who works nearby. Needless to say, romance blooms despite the age difference.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie review: </strong>Older woman. Smarter woman. Younger man. Desirable man. Welcome to the new age relationship which has currently become quite a craze, ever since Demi Moore proved that the much younger Ashton Kutcher could be something more than a toy boy. He could be a husband too. Hence, the allure of the older, alpha woman who's both hot and happening; a delightful blend of substance and sensuality.<br>
<br>
That's what young and sensitive Aram Finklestein (Justin Bartha) sees in his older, wiser, absolutely oomphy employer Sandra (Catherine Zeta-Jones) when she hires him as her nanny. He does begin by baby-sitting her two kids, playing video games with them, enacting American Idol sessions or imitating the Grudge. But very soon, he graduates from just watching her mess up her dates with her sundry boyfriends to being the perfect boyfriend. The mother of two dismisses her dalliance as a one-night stand, but is forced to do a re-check when the nights keep adding up and compatibility keeps growing. This can't be for keeps, she tells herself and ticks off her boyfriend for being so young: he gets drunk on half a beer and reads Harry Potter! Time to go their separate ways? Or time to debunk all traditional limits to love and longing...<br>
<br>
The Rebound is a sweet and sassy little romance that is watchable despite its predictability. And that's because both the lead players don't take themselves too seriously. While Justin Bartha plays nice guy without losing his sense of humour, Catherine Zeta-Jones has a lightness of being that enables her to zip through romance that might otherwise have ended up as routine. Watch her do a Jab We Met a la Kareena when she bad mouths her domineering ex-husband and tells him to rot in hell. And yes, Justin eggs her on to break her silence, just like Shahid Kapur...<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Big town corporate feminazi, Renee Zellweger, is sent to smaller town, Minnesota, to downsize a sick firm in these recessionary times. But before she can hand out the pink slips, she must contend with union leader, Harry Connick Jr. who is quite hard to ignore. And to hate...<br>
<br>
There's something about Renee Zellweger. Something sweet and so very disarming, she makes a run-of-the-mill rom-com watchable. Ever since stealing our hearts with her girl-next-door goodness in Jerry Macguire, Renee has remained the true blue Ms Congeniality in popcorn cinema. Of course, she's a mountain of talent too, as amply displayed in Chicago, Cold Mountain and the Bridget Jones series.<br>
<br>
Here however, it's mainly her charisma that wins you over as she brings life to Lucy, the high-heeled alpha woman who re-locates to cold and freezing Minnesota. First, there's disdain for the small town mentality and then there's love and longing for the uncluttered, closely knit, clan-nish existence of the Minnesotans that stands out in stark contrast to the I-me-mine credo of Miami. More importantly, she loses her heart to the union leader, enfant terrible Ted (Harry Connick Jr.) who predictably begins the relationship on the wrong note.<br>
<br>
Okay, it's predictable we confess, but it's as sweet as the tapioca pudding that seems to be the main course in the film. Watch out for some syrupy moments, a mouthful on cut-throat corporate ethics and some fine performances by Renee and her personal assistant, Siobhan Fallon Hogan, who tries to set her up with the most eligible bachelor in the provincial town.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Orphan Raizo grows up into a ninja assassin after being trained by a heartless head of a warrior clan. But he turns rogue and swears revenge when the brutality of the master becomes too hard to handle.<br>
<br>
Andy Wachowski, the younger sibling in the Wachowski Brothers Inc., confesses in an interview: ``We think movies are fairly boring and predictable. We want to scr*w with audiences' expectations.'' Larry, the elder, thinks so too. Hence the brothers Wachowski go ahead and make The Matrix series which truly turn Hollywood on its head by redefining the action genre. More importantly, they lay the foundation for their brand of cinema which is based on the quintessential American principle of shock and awe, with action as the core of their narrative.<br>
<br>
But hey, it's not just ordinary action where guns explode and people die, any which way. Nah! Normal is truly boring for the Brothers Wachowski. Remember the gravity and speed defying action cuts of The Matrix series? Ninja Assassin, their latest production too tries to follow a similar formula where heads roll, hands are chopped, blood spurts, wounds are split wide open and hearts are gorged out...All this, without an eye-blink or a sense of extreme. The film's rated R, so no apologies for the hardcore violence. Also, it's a ninja story, isn't it. And ninja's are supposed to chop and sock their way through life. So go, get what you expect: loads of ninjas, lots of violence, neatly orchestrated martial arts' sequences and some semblance of a storyline. But no, not The Matrix.<br>
<br>
Refreshingly, the film has a heart too. Raizo (played by South Korean pop singer, Rain), an orphan, is adopted by a cruel martial art's master who heads the Ozunu clan. The clan excels in creating killing machines out of homeless kids by divesting them of all humaneness. Extreme violence and complete heartlessness becomes a way of life for the terrified youngsters who are then supplied as mercenary killers to governments and institutions who want to assassinate anybody. Raizo does grow up to be the best amongst equals, but he goes rogue when the master kills his beloved. He teams up with a forensic researcher in Interpol (Naomie Harris) to set the record straight. And that of course means slicing up all the bad ninjas before setting up the final confrontation with the bad master.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, it's the fight sequences that form the highlight of this film. But the film has its emotional core too as it captures the angst of young Raizo who tries to quell the thundering of his heart in a heartless world. Directed by James McTeigue (V for Vendetta) the film provides interesting viewing for hardcore action film buffs. Watch out for Karl Walter Lindenlaub's cinematography which captures the martial arts' moves in shadowy light, since the Ninja Assassins are mythical, shadowy urban legends who have been killing anyone for 100 pounds of gold over the centuries.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> A celluloid adaptation of Charles Dicken's classic, the story revolves around the redemption of despicable Ebenezer Scrooge who turns over a new leaf one Christmas Eve.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie review:</strong> It's a Jim Carrey show all the way. You may not recognise him at first due to the CGI effects, but it doesn't take long before the Carrey charisma works its magic. He brings to life a Scrooge you've never seen -- or imagined -- before, with his ill-temper and stingy ways that almost reek of cruelty. Until one cold, wintry, Christmas eve...<br>
<br>
Scrooge scoffs at his nephew (Colin Firth) who wants to invite him for Christmas dinner and yells at his clerk (Gary Oldman), before retiring to his desolate home on Christmas Eve. But it's not going to be an ordinary Yuletide for this grumpy old man as he gets hauled up by three ghosts who hold up a mirror to his meanness. Repelled by his anti-social ways, Scrooge, the archetypal misanthrope, metamorphoses into the biggest humanitarian, overnight. He not only re-builds fences with his nephew and neighbours, but he also sends the biggest turkey in town to his impoverished clerk's family. Apart from raising his salary of course...<br>
<br>
Loads of special effects and a story that has stood the test of time: Christmas Carol is Carrey revisited. However, it's not really a children's film and is meant for diehard Dicken's fans.<br>
<br>
A word about...<br>
<br>
Performances: Jim Carrey is heavily made-up, yet striking both as Scrooge and the ghosts who reform Scrooge. The rest of the actors are unrecognisable too, yet they pitch in perfectly as archetypal Dicken's characters.<br>
<br>
Dialogue: Robert Zemeckis captures the world of Charles Dickens perfectly with his screenplay and dialogues. There's an old world charm to the way Ebenezer and the rest of the characters discover the tenets of good living.<br>
<br>
Cinematography: Robert Presley's camera deftly oscillates between the real world, peopled by the down and out and the fantasy world, brimming over with ghosts and visions.<br>

How would you like playing super special baseball with his family amidst thunder and lightning? How would you like a schmaltzy prom dance with him with the lights turned dim? And finally, how would you like to lie all night beside him, while he practises self-control, even while whispering how you are his personal brand of heroin: truly hard to resist?<br>
<br>
All you Twilighters, take the first bus to your favourite audi. This one's ekdum paisa vasool fare. Stephanie Myer's mythical masala about a vegan vampire who falls in love with the girl-next-door, yet refuses to bury his fangs in her, despite the fatal attraction is hot stuff on screen. And all you non-Twilighters -- those who don't know a thing about Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn -- don't despair. For this one's so delightfully mushy, it fills you with an adrenalin rush too. With all that hormonal rush between Edward and Bella and their valiant attempts at self-control, you feel like nodding at the moony vampire when he declares: ``I had an adrenalin rush. It happens. You can Google it.''<br>
<br>
No need to Google, sir. We know. It happens. For, as you say, Bella smells delicious and the lion almost always does fall for the lamb. Also, as you say, being a vegetarian vampire is like being on tofu all your life: it fills your hunger, but doesn't satisfy you, unlike the blood of a beautiful maiden.<br>
<br>
Ironically, it's all these cheesy dialogues which actually become the high point of the film which is an adaptation of Stephanie Myer's teen romance, Twilight, now acquiring cult status. Bella moves to a new town and a new high school mid-session. It's love at first sight for her when she spots Edward, the pallid hunk with painted lips and changing eye colour. The romance acquires a dangerous edge when Bella discovers her boyfriend's a vampire and her town is brimming over with other, more dangerous vampires too. It doesn't take long before she unleashes a full scale war between the vegan and non-vegan vampires. The vegans treat her as family and the non-vegans want her as snack...Truly delicious!<br>
<br>
The film takes a bit long to build up the romance, but once it does, there's no looking back. Kristen Stewart's Bella however isn't as alluring as Robert Pattinson's Edward, now a cult figure in popular culture. Pattison does the tightrope between the undead (he's been 17 since 1918) and the living (he can practice self-control) amicably. But the film actually works because it sculpts a romance that blooms through self-denial and renunciation. Grab your munchies and go for it!<br>
A word about...<br>
<br>
Performances: It's a Robert Pattinson show all the way. His vampire act is quite irresistible, even though he doesn't have much to do in the acting department. Edward Cullen works more because of his body language: tall, muscular, ashen-white, cold yet so very passionate. Kristen Stewart's Bella Swann is relatively too simple and flaccid to hold your attention.<br>
<br>
Dialogues: Melissa Rosenberg renders a faithful adaptation of Stephanie Myer's teen fantasy. The conversation between the vampire and his love are syrupy and sweet: truly the stuff teen romances are made of. Sample this: It's your smell! You're like a drug for me. It's like my own personal brand of heroin, mutters a desperate Edward.<br>
<br>
Cinematography: Elliot Davis creates enough spookiness with the camera to match the supernatural antics of the vampires. The small town of Forks is wet, sunless, misty and a perfect setting for an unnatural love story.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>The sun's sending extra heat due to which planet Earth has a destabilising crust. End result? It's hurtling towards doomsday in 2012, as predicted by the Mayan calendar. Can a father, John Cusack, save his family, a President, Danny Glover, his country, a scientist, Chiwetel Ejiofor, the future...?<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review: </strong>End of the world movies have almost always been engaging. Also, director Roland Emmerich has ended the world time and again through his celluloid epics. Be it the aliens bringing the White House down, the world going into deep freeze or the giant lizard trampling across terra firma, films like Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow and Godzilla have showcased Emmerich as an able prophet of doom. Once again, he churns the oceans, cracks up the earth and sends down fireballs to create a cataclysm that sends humanity into a tizzy. Everyone's on the run, now that they know Earth has an expiry date: December 2012. And before the new world can begin (circa 0001), with a handful of survivors, families must unite, loved one's must be lost, the benevolent must shine and the bad guys be sorted out...In short, the entire gamut of emotions must be run through, even if it takes a prolonged two and half hours to depict the might of man against the fury of nature. Yes, 2012 is too long and ends up taxing your patience in the last 40 minutes where all the drama unfolds inside a submarine-like Noah's ark, brimming over with the survivors, handpicked on different yardsticks. Most of them are there because they could afford to buy themselves a one billion euro berth in the secret ship. Some have connections (like the US president's daughter, the White House chief), some because the new world needs them, like the bright, young scientist, Chiwetel Ejifor, and some -- the good, yet ordinary guys -- are gatecrashers and stowaways (John Cusack and his estranged family). But human drama isn't supposed to be the highlight of any disaster film. Special effects are the main draw. So, you actually don't mind the perfunctory manner in which the director handles his characters' bondings. There's Cusack trying to re-bond with his separated wife (Amanda Peet) and kids. There's the scientist torn with grief because he can't take his dad on the secret ship. There's the US Prez (Danny Glover) who chooses not to abandon his countrymen and prefers to look for a kid's lost daddy, when doom dawns. And there's the scheming wannabe (Oliver Platt) who dreams of becoming Prez when the new world order begins. Oh yes, amongst all these usual types, there's also the mad prophet of doom cum radio jockey (Woody Harrelson), who wants to be the first to bring the news, even if it means standing in the face of a volcano. All the characters try to hold your attention as they battle apocalyptical blues.<br>
<br>
But what really holds your attention is apocalypse itself. Yes, it's the special effects of the film, more than the human drama, which completely sweep you off your feet. You get a cheesy thrill watching larger-than-life waves, fissures, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions wipe off all the famous monuments of the world. The White House is washed away. Eiffel Tower is knocked down. The Sistine Chapel cracks up. Los Angeles splits and California falls off into the sea. And all that survives is a little plane that flys through the falling landscape and a specially crafted ship: a symbol of the invincible human spirit. Truly, there's no one better than Hollywood, when it comes to shock and awe cinema. Director Emmerich knows he can only score with this just-another-disaster flick if he creates a bigger bang when the world ends. And it's here that he succeeds. Despite being low on the emotional quotient, with characters that can be easily forgotten, 2012 remains a larger-than-life entertainer due to its visual splendour.<br>
<br>
And for the desi viewers, there is the special tribute the filmmaker pays to India. It's an Indian astrophycist, Satnam,(Jimy Mistry), working somewhere in East India, who cautions the world about the impending doom. So what if he's the archetypal third world citizen, forced to speak English with a desi accent. And so what if he is conveniently forgotten when the exodus begins. At least the American scientist in the survivors' ship, remembers him when the end begins and the desi geek is washed away by a tsunami, family et al. Shabash India!<br>
<br>
A word about:<br>
<br>
Performances: No one's great. Everyone's okay, just fitting into their roles, without taking your breath away. John Cusack perfects his hangdog look as the ordinary man wih the spirit of a hero, while Amanda Peet doesn't really have much to do. Thandie Newton, a fine actress otherwise, is completely wasted too as the First Daughter. The only actor who stands out amidst the crowd is Chiwetel Ejiofor as the American scientist. And only just.<br>
<br>
Story: Scripted by producer-director Roland Emmerich and Harald Kloser, the film kowtows the demands of a disaster film: it has a flimsy storyline, focussing primarily on survival and unfolds mostly through special effects.<br>
<br>
Cinematography: Great camera work by Dean Semler. The end of the world sequences are absolutely magnificent as are the daring little vignettes of human valour.<br>
<br>
Special Effects: Mike Vezina is the special effects supervisor. And Mike Vezina deserves a kudos. For watching California falling off the map of the world or LA cracking up into a grand canyon sets you gawking like never before.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Corporate crimes have acquired a whole new importance and become Hollywood's favourite subject every since Enron, the Lehman Brothers et al.<br>
<br>
But The Informant! is such a compelling picture of a corporate criminal, it catapults you to the edge of your seat after a langorous beginning that tends to lull you into a sense of false security.<br>
<br>
But hey, just don't sit back and think that this one's just another flick about corrupt trade practices and evil CEOs who see nothing wrong in fixing prices and taking their consmers for a ride. Because more than the unethical policies of Archer Daniel's Midlands, one of the ten largest corporations in America. Soderberh's expose is actually on Mark Whitacre (Matt Damon), the seemingly commonplace official-turned-whistleblower who would have slipped into anonymity if he didn't display his chameleon colours en route the perilous journey.<br>
<br>
Whitacre begins low key, joining hands with the FBI as their special agent who is hellbent on exposing the unfair trade practices of his company. He calls himself 0014 because he's twice as smart as James Bond. Now that's a fact we learn very soon, as whitacre sheds all his holier-than-thou credentials and turns up a criminal himself. Not only has he been playing whistleblower for devious ends -- he hopes to become CEO of his company by getting the top brass out -- he has also been amassing ill-gotten wealth to the tune of $7 million. Or is it $11 million. And the high point is the fact that neither he nor his adoring wife (Melanie Lynskey) think he is a law breaker.<br>
<br>
The film is based on a book by Kurt Eichenwald and features a real life case. ADM was actually sued and fined $100 million for corporate fraud while Mark Whitacre served a long prison sentence, even though he became an American hero who currently heads a hi-tech firm in the US. The film draws its allure from the scintillating performance by Matt Damon who displays a rare psychological depth while bringing to life a character who is so normal, you just can't tell...what's more, he doesn't believe there are any aberrations in his personality, even though he is a habitual liar and a natural-born felon. Watch him fib his way before the FBI: he takes your breath away.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Anyone for a syrupy, mushy, unadulterated romance about a devoted-till-death wife (Rachel McAdams) and a disappearing husband (Eric Bana)?<br>
<br>
This one's definitely for the diehard romantics who like their stories Mills & Boon style. More importantly, it has that delicious touch of the supernatural which makes the mating and meeting unpredictable and non-linear.<br>
<br>
Eric Bana calls himself a time traveler because he has a genetic disorder that causes him to flit between different time zones. All his travellings happens involuntarily and sees him suddenly disappearing and reappearing, much to the discomfiture of all, but one. And that's his wife, Rachel McAdams, who meets him as a young girl offering him a blanket as he apparates as an adult, in the buff, before her. The duo stay together and build up a warm and vibrant relationship despite the time-span variance. The problem in this paradise is Bana's ability to peep into the future, but McAdam is willing to conquer all, in the name of love. Even a time-traveling pregnancy!<br>
<br>
Based on the novel by Audrey Niffenegger, the film is a lyrical and laid back odyssey of love.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>From the vampire-ridden Underworld to sub-zero Antarctica: Kate Bekinsale sure has exotic playgrounds to strut her stuff. But unlike her gothic charms in the Underworld series, Whiteout sees her pallid and frost bitten (she even loses her fingers to frost bite), moving around in heavy thermals and parka hoods for most of the film. Of course, she gets one shower scene to infuse some heat.<br>
<br>
But that's not enough. The drama mostly remains tepid in this thanda thriller that follows the pattern of a routine whodunit as Bekinsale, a US law enforcement officer, tries to chase a hooded, pickax-wielding killer determined to create havoc in the uneventful McMurdo Station in Antarctica. Bekinsale, herself, is quite unsettled, with a stormy past and an uncertain present. She wants to quit and is all set to board the last plane out of Antarctica which leaves in half an hour. But duty calls and the diehard Marshal must ferret out the face of terror from the bunch of men who surround her.<br>
<br>
The film fails to exploit the exotic locales of the South Pole and the twists and turns are mostly predictable in this tundra thriller which is based on a graphic novel by Greg Rucka.<br>

<br>
MJ mania may not reach its hysterical peak with this documentary. But that's not the purpose anyway, for the pop artist has already created a fan following and a fervour that will outlive almost anything...maybe global warming, terrorism and the nuclear holocaust too. Instead, the film works like osmosis. It filters the hysteria into pure devotion. If you had moonwalked and clutched your crotch to Michael Jackson's songs till now, you'll silently send him a salaam, heavenwards, saluting the genius -- and the genteelness -- of a man who gave a whole new meaning to the word ‘entertainer’. The film does stay away from the very personal side of the enigmatic artist, leaving you lusting for a closer dekko at the tormented insides of a man who made a million headlines with his unconventional life and his rule-breaking ways. But when it comes to his music, 'This Is truly It'. Ortega's documentary works magic like a life-altering extended MJ extravaganza, bringing you all his best numbers -- 'Billie Jean', Beat It, Thriller, Man in the Mirror, Feel the Love and more -- leaving you breathless in the end. And completely awestruck too, with the sheer genius of a singer who lived and breathed music for 44 years (out of 50), selling an estimated 750 million albums worldwide.<br>
<br>
So, on the one hand, you have Michael, the performer, upfront, with his somewhat squeaky voice that explodes in a pronounced vibrato as his crotch-grab, in lurex jackets and pants, creates a mesmeric vision. On the other, you have Michael, the man, who not only knows his music to perfection, but treats his team like a perfect gentleman too. Bless you, love you punctuate his pep talk, as his team lovingly labours to project and package him as a living legend. And when he's not getting the right note from his fellow artists, he tells them `it's your time to shine...let go...' Yes, Michael was the visionary who knew every tenor of the music he wanted to create and did not rest until he struck the perfect note. Let's take them to worlds they've never been before, let's show them talent they've never seen before, he gently exhorted.<br>
<br>
Indeed, take your chance. Go where you've never been before. Witness the concert that might have been. Experience the magic of a man who made you jump over the moon.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>The film, set in two time zones, traces the story of two inveterate foodies: Julia Child (Meryl Streep) and Julie Powells (Amy Adams) who mastered the zen of cooking and the art of life, simultaneously.<br>
<br>
If Julia began her culinary journey in the 1940s and taught America how to cook with her skills at French cuisine, then Julie discovered the joy of living in an otherwise joyless life by blogging about 524 recipes in 365 days. Needless to say, Julie, a call centre worker, wasting away during the day in a dull cubicle, drew her inspiration from Julia, the perfect wife and the enviable cook.<br>
<br>
Director Nora Ephron essentially paints portraits of feminine power through her two disparate characters who may be leading dissimilar lives, yet, they are actually two sides of the same coin. Their lives seem to move parallel in an interesting intercutting that traces their journey from boredom to fame as they learn to whip up the cream in their lives. Julia is a bored housewife who lives in Paris with her devoted diplomat husband (Stanley Tucci). Juile is a phone-in assistant who spends her time answering calls on insurance queries from 9/11 victims. She too lives with a much-in-love husband (Chris Messina) who can afford barely a tiny room above a pizzeria in Queens which doubles up as the couple's love nest. Julia takes up cooking as an escape from unexciting bridge classes while Julie takes it up to bide over her daily tedium, as also a tribute to her icon, Julia, the author of the cult book, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, meant exclusively for the `servantless' American homes.<br>
<br>
The film draws most of its charm from the performances and the character studies. Based on real life characters, Ephron relies heavily on Streep to recreate the magic she displayed in The Devil Wears Prada and Adaptation. Streep doesn't disappoint although her Julia is such an exaggerated character, it could have almost ended up a caricature. Amy Adams too is warm and vibrant as the spitfire Julie who gets so immersed in mastering the art of boning the duck or stirring beef stew, she almost breaks up her marriage.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Did you know that guinea pigs are almost human. Well, actually 98 per cent human, as their DNA declares. So what are they doing in pet shops and burrows, playing around as paltry rodents when they can actually be saving the world as special agents working with the FBI.<br>
<br>
Phew! Did we overdo it? Not really. Because Yeatman's film actually makes the heroics of this furry bunch of don't-call-us-rodents seem plausible. The leader of the pack is Darwin (Sam Rockwell), ably assisted by Blaster (Tracy Morgan), Juarez (Penelope Cruz) and Speckles (Nicholas Cage) who happens to be a mole, abeit, the smartest one around, specially with computers. Our personal favourite? Juarez, the feisty femme fatale, who knows how hard it is to survive in a man's world, specially when the man in her life (Darwin) doesn't seem to be interested in her. When she is forced to go underground and live as a little girl's pet, our spunky amazon threatens to eat up her owner's tiny hands when she paints her nails, perches a tiara on her furry head and colours her lips pink. I feel like Paris Hilton's chihuahaha, she yells and tears off everything, except the trendy earring. The foursome, working with their owner Zack Galifianakis (Remember The Hangover?), must sabotage the plans of evil electronic billionaire (Bill Nighy) who wants to launch a world threatening project, Clusterstorm, with his military chip equipped electronic goods.<pi><br>

The action is fun, the humour crisp, the voice-overs effective. Just one sore point: Zack is completely wasted as the guinea pigs' sidekick, specially after a scintillating show in The Hangover.<br>

So far so good. And then begins the magic. A colourful magical rock that helps our young hero ``make a wish'' which includes giving it back to the school bully, creating a special fort full of crocodiles and snakes, special superpowers to fly to school, unlimited supply of chocolates, fighting the bad guy. Sadly, the magic soon goes from pillar to post creating utter confusion and chaos in Black Hills. But hold on: our hero finally thinks it best to use it for global warming and world peace. Of course, he later throws it away. Surprised? We don't really need a magic stone to tackle global warming, terrorism, world peace and even relationships with parents (``The cellphones disconnects us from real interaction. So dump it'' is just one real suggestion).<br>
<br>
Wondering what's short about Shorts? Not the message. Not even the chaos. Just the lack of hi-tech special effects and the chaotic structure of the story which lurches back through a series of disjointed flashbacks (called shorts). And that's where you might end up blinking!<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Everybody knows about Woodstock, the milestone music concert that changed the world. But does anybody know about the people who made it possible, besides the musicians and the hippies who are now part of history?<br>
<br>
Here's where Ang Lee's film scores, turning its attention away from the actual concert and the larger-than-life artists to the freedom-loving commoners who saw the cause behind the concert.<br>
<br>
Based on Elliot Tiber's book, the film focuses more on the experiences of a conventional youngster who lives a predictable, unexciting life with his parents, rather than the rule-breakers and the flower people. Young Elliot isn't wrong when he exclaims he is that rare breed of youth who chooses to have breakfast, every morning, with his parents (Henry Goodman and Imelda Staunton), while helping them to run their decrepit motel, the El Monaco. The only unconventional element in his life is the bunch of hippies living in his barn, much to the discomfiture of his stern, disciplinarian mom.<br>
<br>
But Elliot gets his chance to discover his wild side when he lets out his land to the music producer (Jonathan Groff) who wants to organise the Woodstock music concert, simply because `there's a lot of joy of music' and he wants to share the joy with the world. Elliot's journey to adulthood begins as he hobnobs with the hippies and discovers the libertine way of life.<br>
<br>
For those expecting a blast of flower power hysteria, the film might be a disappointment. As it would for those expecting another Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon from a high-on-style Ang Lee. But for those who'd like to decipher why the hippie cult was so alluring to the earth-bound, Taking Woodstock is low-key yet lyrical.

Reason? The real Bruce is too sad after having lost his son and almost losing his wife (Radha Mitchell) to unbearable grief.<br>

Things do brighten up when Bruce's surrogate suffers a mishap and the cop is forced to come out of semi-retirement to solve the murder of several surrogates, in a futuristic world that is fast learning to say no to robots and reserving special places `only for humans'. It's a move that sees Bruce not only cleaning up the metallic grime, but also infusing a whole lot of Emotional Quotient back into a mecha world. And yes, it's a step that gets him back to his not-so-perfect wife who had sent out her coiffured surrogate to cope with harsh reality.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>The captured Nazi officer is defiant, almost pugnacious. *uck you, he says, to officer Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) ferreting him for information.<br>
<br>
The answer to that is a moment of silence. Soon we hear the first notes of eerie music, a foreboding of something sinister. Then from the heart of a tunnel a shadowy figure emerges with a baseball bat in hand. What we witness in the next few seconds is violence in its most raw and pristine form. The baseball bat comes with the swiftness of a hurricane and the savage power that only pure hate can unleash. We hear the sound of wood meeting skull. It's gruesome. It's Quentin Tarantino - with the subtext that the Allies were pretty brutal too.<br>
<br>
Inglourious Basterds isn't littered with such moments of intense savagery though one also gets to see scalps being knifed off the skull. But watching it we always feel a sense of looming menace that's almost Hitchcockian. In ordinary situations - be it a German officer drinking milk or biting into his apple strudel with fresh cream - we sense the possibilities of limitless terror, touch the mad angles of fear.<br>
<br>
Tarantino tells the story in chapters. The movie has the feel of reading a novel visually. Not every chapter is immediately linked to what has happened before. But that's Tarantino. We know the jigsaw pieces will eventually fall into place.<br>
<br>
Inglourious Basterds is certainly not the sort of wartime yarn that Hollywood produced with relish in the 1960s: The Great Escape, The Dirty Dozen and many more. By the time the lights come on, we know we haven't been watching pure history either. Instead, we catch engrossing drama created by long dialogues. The scenes are unhurried. We get a 1940s sense of time. The opening scene, primarily a conversation between a French farmer and an SS Colonel, lasts almost 20 minutes.<br>
<br>
Most Tarantino flicks generally have a stand-out performer. Here it is Christoph Waltz, the Jew-hunting German colonel. Charming, intelligent and ruthless --- Waltz gets every aspect of the part spot-on. Without him, Inglourious Basterds wouldn't have been half the movie it is. As a nonchalant, almost careless leader of the inglourious basterds team, Brad Pitt throws in a heavy accent but is pretty lightweight otherwise.<br>
<br>
Inglourious Basterds isn't heavy adrenalin action. It's a war movie without much war but plenty of menace. It's a sort of exploration of mentalities that wars create in us: reasons to kill, an urge to hurt. The movie needs to be enjoyed slowly like good wine. There's pleasure in its details. But you'll have to do the hard work of finding them yourself, as in any decent work of art.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Every other child in the orphanage is playing. She is the only one who sits alone painting. That's when John Coleman (Peter Sarsgaard) walks into the room.<br>

He is impressed by her work and strikes up a conversation. Esther, the nine-year-old orphan (Isabelle Fuhrman), turns out to be mature, bright and well-mannered. Almost immediately, John and his wife Kate (Vera Farmiga) adopt her.<br>
<br>
Kate has a history of tragedy; she has lost her third baby in childbirth. Trouble keeps chasing her like bumblebees. She has just overcome a drinking problem and her visits to the psychiatrist continue. But she is smarter than her husband and can see what he doesn't: that Esther is far too self-assured and measured to be a child. When things start going wrong -- she is always found in places where murder, beatings, arson happen – in the beautiful wood-panelled house they live in, she knows something is very wrong.<br>
<br>
Orphan makes sinister sexy. Logic isn't always the script's strong point. But director Jaume Collet-Serra forces you to gloss over them. The film is shot in winter, the sheet of cold white across the canvas helps build the movie's dark mood.<br>
<br>
The script is favourably disposed to Esther. And Fuhrman shines in the part of a Russian orphan who plays Tchaikovsky like a master and wields the pickaxe like a demon. Somewhere in the middle of the movie we come to know that she is capable of expressing her darkest emotions through violence. But to what degree can she succeed? That's what keeps us hanging to the edge of our seats.<br>
<br>
Orphan is chilling without trying too hard to be so. And as we move towards the climax, it almost turns horrifying. Those who enjoy getting up, close and personal with evil will love this. But those who want to adopt a child might well end up having second thoughts.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>With director Sam Mendes, you can always expect the unexpected. He has done the dark comedy (American Beauty), the gangsta flick (Road to Perdition), the brutally introspective (Jarhead) and the off-beat drama (Revolutionary Road).<br>
<br>
In an age when most prefer to play safe, he is happy experimenting with genres. And that's worthy of admiration. In Away We Go as well, Mendes walks a different path, crafting a movie that smells like a road flick but is actually a drama without drama.<br>
<br>
Middle-aged and middle-class, Burt (John Krasinski) and Verona (Maya Rudolph) aren't married but certainly a couple. The first scene shows a head bobbing up and down beneath the sheets with Burt making loud noises as if eating a hot pickle. We soon get to see the after-effects of that amorous night – Verona's six-month swollen tummy that looks it has an eight-month baby inside.<br>
<br>
The journey towards parenthood evokes a host of emotions in the couple: none stronger than anxiety. And when Burt's parents surprise them by announcing that they are moving to Antwerp for a couple of years, they know that changing diapers at 2 am isn't going to be their only problem. As the two embark on a journey that takes them to places like Phoenix, Tucson, Madison, Montreal and Miami (in that order), they seem to discover more about life and togetherness. In the end, there's no great illumination. But perhaps more understanding, more wisdom that might help them sail the choppy seas of parenthood together.<br>
<br>
Away We Go has some masterly old soundtracks from George Harrison, Bob Dylan and Lou Reed. Languidly paced, it has symmetry all its own. But in the end, it is like a could-have-been-good flick that leaves you less than satisfied and vaguely unfulfilled. We really don't know what the two protagonists are looking for. Their friends and relatives – Verona's friend who can't speak a sentence without using the F-word, the breast-feeding pal who hates rollers and a relative who philosophises as he pours syrup over toast, 'You have to be willing to make the family from whatever' – don't seem characters from everyday life but plucked from the margins. Perhaps, Mendes is trying to tell us, each to his own. That's a good philosophy to live with. But you need not watch a weekend movie to know that.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Every once in a while comes a movie as endearing as a grandmother's lap, as joyous as Tendulkar on song. UP is that kind of a movie: a magical joyride on 10,000 balloons that fills you with an unbearable lightness of being, and literally as well as figuratively, takes you to cloud nine.<br>
<br>
Crafted in the Disney-Pixar stable, Oscar-nominated director Pete Docter's flight of imagination evokes the feel of adventure, comedy and drama -- sometimes all at the same time. And if you occasionally get the impression of watching a buccaneering cartoon version of Indiana Jones, that's ok too.<br>
<br>
The movie's first 15 minutes are its weakest. And on first impression, there is little appealing about UP's protagonist: Carl Fredricksen, a grumpy, pugnacious widower with a shock of white hair, big glasses and the squarest face you will ever see. Perhaps the oldest Hollywood hero of this millennium, Carl is still wedded to the memory of his wife (Ellie) who has left behind an album of their unfulfilled dream: a visit to Paradise Falls in South America. Part of the old man's crankiness comes from a feeling of helplessness. The land surrounding his house has been taken over by real estate builders. The noise and dust raised by the construction irritates Carl. That's why he turns snappy when egg-headed Russell, an earnest but bumbling kid, knocks at his door.<br>

But Carl has a surprise for everyone. Using helium-filled balloons, he hauls his house above the ground and makes it soar. With Russell as accidental company, a rollicking voyage follows --- in the air and on the ground --- as a crazy explorer and his ferocious pack of dogs hunt for a rare multi-coloured bird that the duo has discovered. Two of an unkind, Carl and Russell make a great team. The change of tenor in their relationship -- from tolerance to bonding --- never feels fake.<br>
<br>
It's been six years since Finding Nemo (2003) hit the screens but we still fondly and vividly remember the small fish, his father, even those sharks with mouths wider than India Gate. The characters of UP are equally unforgettable. Kevin, the flightless bird that looks like an ostrich but is feathered like a rainbow, is delightful. The scene where she flings Russell like a ball of wool in the air and rocks him like a baby makes for the movie's most affectionate moments. And Dug, the golden mutt who behaves like a lamb, is as cute as it gets.<br>
<br>
Neatly scripted with first-rate production values --- in the climax, the swordfights and the fighter aircraft stunts are edge-of-the-seat stuff --- UP is like a wish granted for all. What more can you ask for in times of swine flu and fake austerity measures?<br>

"<div class='Normal'>At a time when Hollywood can't have enough of romantic comedies, extreme action and sci-fi adventure comes a family drama that's both powerful and rewarding.<br>
<br>
Part of My Sister's Keeper is about the ethics that often involve issues of life and death. But for much of it, it is simply a compelling story of the Fitzgerald family, of the things that hold them together and the issues that make them fall apart. The movie sucks you into their lives.<br>
<br>
The story is centred around two sisters -- Kate (Sofia Vassilieva) and Anna (Abigail Breslin). Their lives are not entirely their own. Kate has leukaemia and Anna was procreated by parents (Cameron Diaz and Jason Patric) to keep her elder sister alive. Kate loves her sister madly. But when it comes to donating her kidney, she refuses and goes to a lawyer for medical emancipation.<br>
<br>
It is a far more complicated affair but the beauty of My Sister's Keeper lies in the way director Nick Cassavetes (The Notebook) handles his material fashioned from Jodi Picoult's novel. Wonderfully edited, the movie moves back and forth in time but never loses narrative focus. It helps that the movie has some wonderful soundtrack that articulate the mood of its strategic moments.<br>
<br>
The key characters stand out: Sarah (Cameron Diaz), the strong and opinionted mother who's too blinded by the idea of prolonging her daughter's life to see the big picture, Brian (Jason Patric), the fireman father who has the wisdom and the heart to see what's going wrong. So do Kate and Anna - who follow the voices of their hearts in their own way. Even the minor characters -- the attorney and the judge -- are wonderfully etched.<br>
<br>
Two scenes will long stay in memory. One, where love happens in the time of chemotherapy as Kate falls for a young patient undergoing treatment. The desire to bond and seek every form of pleasure at the time of dying is both touching and tear-drawing. Two, when the family takes Kate, by then in an advanced stage of the disease, to the beach. Those movie minutes are touched by magic.<br>
<br>
The beauty of My Sister's Keeper is that despite all the talk of death, it never feels morbid, even heavy. 'There's no shame in dying,' says the judge, at one point. And we agree with her.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Grim and nerve-jangling, this one's for every hardcore sci-fi fan. When a spaceship lands in Johannesburg (probably because director Neill Blomkamp is a South African), humans need to evict the aliens because living space is scarce.<br>
<br>
So eager hero Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley), who works at Multi-National United (MNU), is sent with troops to politely ask the aliens to leave. Incidentally, MNU also happens to be the second largest weapon manufacturer in the world and is interested in alien weapons. To further spice up the scene, Nigerian gangs abound in District 9 and regularly resort to voodoo and killing of the aliens to imbibe `powers from outer space'.<br>
<br>
District 9 is about the tussle between humans and aliens, the former hanker after power and weaponry while the latter (a la ET) only want to go home.<br>
<br>
Full marks to first-time director Blomkamp for making the audience actually feel the helplessness and despair of the ugly mechanised creatures. Copley makes it almost impossible to believe this is his first film as an actor. He's also the film's co-producer with Peter Jackson. Disturbingly powerful visual effects and a dark background score add to the film's appeal. Worth a viewing but make sure you only catch the English version. There's also a Hindi version doing the rounds.<br>

factories with giant wheels, the huge eerie black towers, the metal garbage
strewn across the landscape - all combine to create a savage setting. But it is
the state-of-the-art special effects and great lens-work that create a really
engrossing flick. The action sequences, especially the one involving a maniacal,
metallic flying beast, are wonderfully crafted. <br><br>What elevates 9 a
notch above the regular sci-fi tale is its ability to create empathy for its
strange-looking heroes: the stitchpunks. The cute midget-sized figures with big,
round expressive eyes take the fight to the giant machines. It is the typical
David and Goliath setting. But we root for the 'small creations' for their
willingness to challenge themselves against impossible odds. They become what we
perhaps aspire to be. <br><br>The lead characters have numbers as names. The
movie borrows its title from the name of the gang's young leader. 9 is
aggressive and intelligent whereas 1, the wise Oriental-looking patriarchal
leader, is cautious. 1 wants to hide, 9 wants to fight. Their debate becomes a
lesson in decision-making. In the end, the scientist regrets making the machines
that destroyed mankind (and womankind too) because he realizes that they can be
corrupted by the corrupt. In its sub-text, 9 urges us to avoid the
pitfall.<br><br>At one level, 9 can be enjoyed purely as a racy sci-fi
fantasy weaved around the time-honoured themes of bravery and friendship. But
the movie, co-produced by Tim Burton, can also be viewed as a moral document, as
an allegory of choices. Either way, 9 is fine.<br><br><a href='http://photogallery.indiatimes.com/articleshow/4945904.cms' target='_blank' style='font-size:10pt;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;color:#0000FF'>Check

"<div class='Normal'>There's an old joke about a 3D movie. A man watching a 3D flick asks the guy sitting in front of him, 'Please take off your hat. It is blocking my view.<br>

'Damn it,' the man replies, 'I am in the movie.' Now with high-definition 3D technology, that joke is almost true.<br>

Watching the speed machines in top gear in The Final Destination, you feel you're sitting in the middle of the racetrack in danger of being run over. And on more than one occasion, you shift uneasily to avoid getting hit by flying objects, mostly body parts of the actors. One shot where a flying tyre hits a young woman spilling her guts out would delight blood and gore addicts.<br>
<br>
But the 3D novelty wears off in about 15 minutes. Then the movie has little to offer except more of the same. Every scene is scripted to show new ways of dying - getting dragged in a tow truck that explodes or getting sucked in a swimming pool exhaust and the likes. By the end, even biology students and cannibals would have had difficulty in naming the different parts of human anatomy on view: intestines, heart, marrow.<br>

This time with globe trotting that just got a little more exciting with con men, do-or-die situations, catchy one liners, run of the mill ideas, convoluted crime, the scenic beauty of Prague, moves where nothing's spelled out and brothers Stephen and Bloom.<br>
The mission, of course, is for ``everyone to get what everyone wants''. But before that there's the growing-up years of the executor of the plan Bloom, (Adrien Brody) and the man calling the shots, Stephen (Mark Ruffalo) who run from one foster home to the other with their little tricks, petty lies, numerous runs, little cons, big cons, complex cons and the last and final con.<br>
<br>
Enter show stopper heiress Penelope (Rachel Weisz). Typical of most rich Hollywood heiresses, what makes her stand out is what she loves doing: Chainsaw juggling, learning rap music, excelling in the Japanese art of Origami. In short what she calls collecting hobbies. But it's only when brother Bloom falls in love with the charming Penelope that the trick and treat story gets even more deadly. That Penelope may end up being more unpredictable than all the crookster combined is another tale all together. A special mention for Rinko Kikuchi who despite the limited vocabulary of three English words steals the show as the brothers silent assistant, Bang Bang, in a world that know no cellphones and mad hurry, but cravats, black hats, retro style statements.<br>
<br>
But does everyone get what everyone wants? Indeed! While little Bloom gets to be the author of his own ``unwritten life'' as a hopeless romantic type rather than big bro, senior Bloom finds solace in his self-created anti-hero character.

In this case, to fight the corrupt arms dealer Destro (Christopher Eccleston) and the growing menace of the Cobra organization that threatens the world with chaos unlimited.

In this case, Baroness (Seinna Miller), incidentally the movie's most compelling character, with her new brunette look, black leather outfit, sexy glasses, one-of-its-kind dialogue delivery and her I-am-the-pure-evil attitude that has enough oomph to keep the adrenalin pumping. Of course, super villainy is reserved for the Cobra Commander (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) often disguised in varied garbs.

"<div class='Normal'>Jenny gave him his first friendship ever. Jenny gave him his first moment of jealousy. Jenny gave his first gift ever. Jenny gave him his first camera.<br>
<br>
And thus was born superstar photographer Connor Mead, who gave Jenny her first heart burn ever. And like all previous rich, spoilt brats, Connor too thinks marriage is an archaic, corrupt institution that needs to be abolished ASAP, and casual sex is but no crime at all. Now, haven't we seen all that before!<br>
Hold on. This time there's a change of our no-heart-just-mind hero who is man enough to admit he was stupid: it's the heart that rules the world more than the head. Courtesy, (no not Jenny), but three ghosts in one single pre-wedding night, led by none other than his iconic uncle, Wayne. So what if the icon admits living life his style ain't a sign of the sane. And the rest as we know, is history. Enter the great transformation of the herbivore man to soppy romantic.<br>
<br>
But what really seems to work here are the extremely watchable characters. First is Connor Mead ( McConaughey) perfect as the over-tanned ladies' man, minus those fruity lovey-dovey speeches, who thinks the real problem is that he loves all women. Adding the much-needed (and perhaps the must-watch) comic grace is Uncle Wayne (Michael Douglas) who's hilariously well-cast as the lecherous uncle and mentor. For the record, he's never worn a seat belt and can't teach our wannabe playboy algebra or ethics, but only ``matters pertaining to dames''. But the real heart of the film is Jenny (Jennifer Garner), who manages to convey a realistic combo of brittleness, female strength, loads of rage and longing, even as she thinks Mr playboy is actually a sweetheart. So what if the star shutterbug is not good at taking pics of those with clothes on! At least he could woo her!<br>
<br>
So, just in case you like a romcom that tugs at your heart strings, there's loads of senti speeches, overwhelming cuteness, romantic-realisation-of-love moments, tender touches till our hero realises he's got all except the love of his life. Of course, with its share of a few funny sequences in that night of realisation -- a downpour of chocolates (gifted by our playboy to the ones he cheated), tissues (used by our playboys' ex girlfriends after he dumped them) and certain unmentionable ofcourse.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>How many times has Hollywood revelled in the gangster film? Countless times, with almost every notable actor having tried his hand at essaying the Bonnie and Clyde fable or the Scarface anti-heroics.<br>
<br>
And yet, there are still some directors who manage to reinvent the genre, even though the gangster hero's dalliance with crime and his cat-and-mouse brush with the law is something you've seen before.<br>
<br>
Director Michael Mann's one such auteur who creates a whole new atmospherics for his period biopic on John Dillinger, the balsy bank robber who plagued the law agencies with his daring heists during the Depression years. Shot in high-definition digital, the film is high on detail and pictoral opulence as it meticulously captures the rise and sudden fall of Dillinger, the simple Indiana farm boy who grew up to become one of Chicago's most famous outlaws. The film is brimming over with scintillating action set pieces which include daring prison breaks, gritty shoot-outs against grand backdrops (forests, streets, grasslands) and high-tension heists with Johnny Depp unleashing his charm on the teller with a sugary: Get me the money, honey.<br>
<br>
In fact, Johnny Depp is the heart and soul of the film with his smooth and easy charm and his languid air. He brings to life a fedora-donning outlaw who loves his job and is even quite proud of it. `I rob banks', he openly declares and sweeps the sweet Ms Cottilard off her feet with his don't-give-a-damn attitude and his succinct self-introduction: `I love fast cars, golf, whiskey and you.' In fact, Marion Cottilard, a simple hatcheck girl is the only chink in his armour. Otherwise, there is nothing that can stop our unflappable gunman from leading the good life by ill-gotten means. Not even the dogged FBI agent Melvin Pervis (Christian Bale) who was determined to get Dillinger to the gallows. It's a nerve-wracking battle between the two, with the cop ending up as the loser, most of the times. He does manage to arrest the robber after a daring heist, but slipping out of prison's seems to be child's play for the man who fears nothing.<br>
<br>
It is this fearlessness that works as a double edged sword for our anti-hero. On the one hand, it gives us one of the most memorable scenes in a gangster film where the most wanted criminal, Depp walks into the Chicago police headquarters, take a leisurely touristy trip down the rooms, smirks at his pictures on the walls and even asks for the Yankees' score after spotting a bunch of cops intently listening to the radio. Again, in another incident, he brazenly sits in his Buick in the street, while the cops arrest his girlfriend from the apartment in front and quiz her on his whereabouts. They fail to notice his presence, simply because they cannot believe he would be right there in the busiest part of the city. But it is this devil-may-care attitude that ends up as his undoing. For the cops try to close in as he enjoys a Clark Gable gangster flick in a crowded auditorium, minus all cover.<br>
<br>
The film is a cinematic treat with its artistic canvas, its fine detailing and its towering portrayal of a real-life bandit by Johnny Depp, an actor who always manages to astound you with his kaleidoscopic skills.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>John Woo returns to his Asian roots after a long gap of 17 years. And he returns with a huge reputation to live up to, having carved an enviable niche for himself in Hollywood with films like Mission Impossible, Broken Arrow and Face/Off. Ostensibly, he is the first Asian director to strike gold in mainstream Hollywood, much before Ang Lee mesmerised the West with Sense and Sensibility and Brokeback Mountain.<br>
<br>
With Red Cliff, he takes on an ambitious project that ends up as one of the most expensive Chinese productions, mounted at a staggering cost of $80 million. But more than the money, it is the scale of the film that is majestic as it tries to analyse the art of warfare through a period film set in China's contentious past.<br>
<br>
Woo sets his film in 208 AD when China was divided into three warring kingdoms. Each kingdom has its own hero, determined to defend territory at all cost. This time however, the Kingdoms of the south and the west come together in order to ward of the advancing armies of General Cao Cao (Zhang Fengyi) who seems to be the mightiest of them all, with an army of 800,000 soldiers. Only Tony Leung and Takeshi Kaneshiro, the brave generals from the other two camps, can act as spoilsport and prevent the power hungry Cao Cao from conquering the Red Cliff, a symbol of the sovereignty of the southern kingdom. But victory doesn't depend on the strength and might of the navy, army and cavalry alone in this copy book case of war; it depends on strategy too, which could empower even a lesser equipped band of warriors. As in the case of our defenders who use the direction of the wind to win an almost no-win battle.<br>
<br>
Don't go looking for Zhang Yimou's period epics; nor expect the anti-gravity athleticism of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and you might just be mesmerised by John Woo's grandiose battles. But what you will sorely miss is the breathtaking cinematography and the feminine mystique that is so intrinsic to Chinese epical cinema. Of course there is the much touted cinematic debut of model Lin Chiling as Mrs Tony Leung and there is Vicky Zhao playing the feistyPrincess Sun Shan Xiang who infiltrates enemy territory. But, by and large, they remain by-standers in this all-male drama which mostly has one thing to boast about: the chemistry between Tony Leung and Takeshi Kaneshiro.<br>

Like Teddy Roosevelt, Rodin's Thinker, Einstein and Abe Lincoln. But the real chutzpah lies with the new recruit in the war of good against evil: adorable Amelia Earhart, the feisty woman who flew the plane across the Pacific. This time, she flies the Wright Brother's stringy machine in another do-or-die mission for the man she's smitten with: Daley of course.

"<div class='Normal'>The film is indeed a timely release. It traces the loneliness, anguish and pathos of Michael (Diego Luna), a performer who tries to make a living as a Michael Jackson impersonator in the streets of Paris.<br>

Hey, is that the impersonator or the original speaking!<br>

Michael however isn't the only imitator here. There is the double of Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Chaplin, Abe Lincoln, James Dean, The Pope, Shirley Temple, Red Riding Hood, Madonna, the Three Stooges....All of them living in a desolate commune in the Scottish highlands, as one great family. And all of them ending up as a bunch of lonely and lost weirdoes hoping to make a living by leading a life that isn't their own. Add to this, a sad and unrequited love story between Michael and Marilyn, a dose of domestic abuse by Chaplin and a delicious sub-plot of flying nuns in a South American hamlet, and you have a delightful tale of dying dreams, crumbling faith and human anguish.<br>
<br>
But don't get bogged down by the heavy theme, for Mister Lonely is absolutely zany and wild, with imagery and allegory that borders on the never-before. The film is a visual feast with montages that completely push the frontiers of the creative imagination.

And the fact that it manages to actually piece together a bizarre story about recognisable characters trapped in absolutely unrecognisable circumstances only goes to prove that this is one of the zaniest screenplays too in recent times. Can you think of a plausible reason behind the presence of a roaring tiger, a bawling baby, a chicken, a broken tooth, a pierced belly button, a vanished inmate from an expensive hotel suite in Las Vegas? Writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore can, with a flourish and a panache that manages to put all the improbable loose ends together in a cogent it-happened-one-night adventure.<br>
<br>
Doug (Justin Bartha) is all set to marry his girlfriend. But before he settles down to husband-hood, he decides to celebrate his bachelor's party with his best buddies, dentist Stu (Ed Helms) and school teacher Phil (Bradley Cooper) in Las Vegas. At the last minute he decides to invite his fiance's brother, Alan (Zach Galifianakis) too. Nothing wrong with that, except that Alan's some kind of a sociopath -- weird, yet adorable, all at the same time. The foursome book themselves an expensive villa at Caesar's Palace, not before Alan has asked the receptionist whether Caesar actually lived there! After that, it's straight to the terrace, where they toast each other with shots of Jagermeister and then wake up the next morning, with no memory of the night revelry. All they know is that Stu has a broken tooth, Phil a hospital tag, Alan a pierced belly button and Doug reported as missing. Adding to their woes is the crying baby in the cupboard, the roaring tiger in the bathroom and a police car that has replaced their Mercedes.<br>
<br>
Any explanations anyone? Before the bride panics, the friends must find the groom. It's a search that leads them to a sweet hooker (Heather Graham) who says she's Stu's wife, a naked Chinese gangster who wants 80k, a belligerent Mike Tyson who wants his stolen tiger back and a final showdown in the Mojave desert. Needless to say, the journey ends up as a therapeutic exercise for all the players who return as better adjusted individuals, ready to cope with routine in a revitalised way.<br>

A great fun ride, The Hangover introduces a whole new bunch of talent to Hollywood, specially Zach, the nerd. Don't miss it.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Walt Disney have always been the pioneer in animation features. And Bolt does not disappoint with its state-of-the-art animation and its drmatic voice-overs, specially by John Travolta as Bolt, the super dog, and Miley Cyrus as Penny, his adolescent mistress.<br>
<br>
Bolt has been living an unnatural life ever since his puppy dog days. Almost like the Truman Show, he too has been bred to believe the unreal is real; that the world actually has an evil green-eyed man (Malcolm McDowell) who is hell bent on harming his `person', Penny; that the only way he can protect her is with his special stare, his special punch and his special bark that turns everything, including tanks and copters, into smithereens. Bolt's method acting is the only way the TRPs of the popular television show will keep on rising, believe the producers and the directors. Hence, it's no home, no chasing balls, no goofy walks in the park for our poor little star pooch.<br>
<br>
But all this only until Bolt gets separated from Penny and finds himself transported from LA to New York. Then, out there in the rough and tumble of life, he learns that a growling stomach means he's hungry, which means he must beg for food. Naturally, these are lesson of life that come with great difficulty, only after he befriends an alley cat who tells him he is ordinary, not special. But, she also tells him how ordinary can be special too....<br>
<br>
Now this one's a fun film for the entire family, with little lessons on love and friendship you can carry home with you. Lessons you learn from a dog, a cat and a hamster.<br>

Is Wright the new Terminator who switches sides, like Arnold Schwarzennegar did in the earlier sequels? Is he a friend or foe to Connor and his kin?

And love. In all his earlier three outings as Logan/Wolverine, the man with the metal claws, Hugh Jackman, has perfected the role of the angst-ridden savior who prefers to doggedly follow his mission, minus all distractions. And the fact that he has no memory of his past only makes his detachment more pronounced.<br>
<br>
It's time to stop wondering now. For director Gavin Hood goes back to the nineteenth century to trace the origins of Wolverine's super powers along with with his weltanshaung (read worldly despair). Now Gavin Hood's the Oscar-winning South African director who won the Best Foreign Film Award for Tsosti, his film on juvenile gangs in Johannesburg. Naturally, he brings to Hollywood his native style of gritty narration and sepia imagery that formed the hallmark of Tsotsi. All this, without abandoning the extravagance and high-adrenalin action quintessential to Hollywood blockbuster fare. End result? A visually overpowering, high testosterone prequel to Marvel Comic's popular super hero who incidentally has been voted the number one comic book hero in a recent poll.<br>

But you actually won't mind 17 Again, despite the familiar story line, because there's something sweet and so very old-fashioned about a dad (Matthew Perry) who becomes a high school hero (Zac Efron) and tries to tutor his kids (now his classmates) in the ways of the world.<br>
<br>
Yes, Perry ostensibly slips back into his youth in order to rewrite his life's story which seems to have hit dead end. His promotion is denied, divorce is round the corner and his kids don't respect him. Maybe, he can escape the bitter truth if he goes back to the best years of his life and makes a different choice.

"<div class='Normal'>A few weeks ago we got to see the srious side of Jackie Chan as the unsmiling, revenge-thirsty Hong Kong cop in New Police Story. This week, he returns again in his unsmiling avtar as Steelhead, the simple Chinese F.O.B who lands in downtown Tokyo (Shinjuku), takes refuge with the rest of the Chinese immigrants living in Tokyo's seamy and slummy areas and ends up as their savior. Steelhead actually came to Tokyo looking for his girlfriend, but before he can find her, he must raise the battle cry for the dignity and honour of the exploited illegal Chinese immigrants. It's a battle which sees him locking horns, first with the Taiwanese underworld and then with the warring Yakuza, after he saves the life of one of them.<br>
Poor, love-lorn Steelhead. The man he saved turns out to be his girl friend's husband and makes him an offer he cannot refuse. He promises him legal status if he kills a few rival gangsters for him. Now that's a request he can hardly refuse, specially since his ex still looks longingly at him.<br>
<br>
It's a hard-hitting action drama, with some gritty and gut-wrenching violence. And surprisingly, you don't actually miss the buffoon you grew to love in the Rush Hour series since Chan has successfully changed his colours to a more morally ambiguous and sombre grey. Go for the difference.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Space has indeed been the final frontier for Hollywood's grandiose drama. But, while most film academicians may nominate the George Lucas Star War series as the mother of all space adventures, Star Trek too glitters in a galaxy not far behind. The time and space transcending bond between Captain Kirk and pointy-eared Spock are truly the stuff legends are made of. As are their sundry adventures which see them piloting the peace-keeping armada of the USS Enterprise from one planet to the other, taming rebels and adding friends to the intergalactic Federation.<br>
<br>
The film was meant to reinvigorate the franchise which had gained popularity in the form of a television series with actors William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy creating cult characters of the two legendary space gladiators, Captain Kirk and Mr Spock. Reinvigorate, it does. But even more than that, it creates a spectacle that scores both in terms of its sheer visual opulence and its vibrant characters. On the one hand, there is the shock and awe factor which has the viewer sitting back and watching black holes swallow up whole planets along with a gravity defying physical combat on the deck of a hurtling space ship. On the other, there is the crackling relationship between a rakish, rebellious twenty-something Kirk (Christopher Pine) and the clinically logical, yet emotional Vulcan-human Spock (Zachary Quinto) which keeps you glued to your seat.

For all those Dan Brown fans who raised mumblings of discontent after the cinematic version of Da Vinci Code failed to live up to the book, there's sweet relief this week. For the film version of Angels and Demons is definitely a page turner, unput-downable to the very core. It takes you on an unbridled roller-coaster ride through the intrigues of Vatican city, trying to uncover what goes on not only behind the pristine walls of the legendary Sistine Chapel but also the other historic churches that become dungeons of hell, when misused.<br>

Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summarily pulled out of the swimming pool by the Vatican police and airjacked to Vatican City after the untimely death of one of the most progressive popes who didn't actually see a conflict between science and faith. The Pope's death is just part of the problem, since Langdon must find out who has kidnapped the four potential papal candidates, known as the Preferati and placed a bomb in one of the sundry churches that dot the city. Now that's not an ordinary bomb, as the beautiful Ms Vettori (Ayelet Zurer), a scientist from the CERN lab, tells us.

"<div class='Normal'>This Dutch film has won the special jury award at Cannes and is heavily recommended for two reasons. First, because it is a text book case to show what cinematography is all about. Watch the director reinvent the function of the camera in cinema from the very first shot which captures the skyscape from a static long shot as it passes from darkness to dawn. Accompanying the passage of stars to the first sun rays is the changing audio track, which once again captures the natural cadence of a countryside where the crickets and the frogs give way to the cows and the cocks. The director repeats the prolonged shot at the end of the film, only this time, dusk turns to darkness, and leaves you completely mesmerised. Never seen the camera serenade nature like this before. In fact, the entire film is an artistic compendium of interesting long shots which langorously bring out the trauma of an extra-marital affair on a simple, god fearing family that believes in love and togetherness.<br>
<br>
Secondly, the film is notable for its extreme simplicity and its minimalism as it captures the mess that love can be, if it happens at the wrong time, the wrong place. Middle aged Johan falls in love with Maria and is irresistibly drawn towards her, despite being fervently devoted to his wife Esther and his family of six kids. He tells his wife of his extra-marital affair and promises to find a solution to the tangle. But Johan takes too long to make his choice between the two women he loves. So much so, his silent, mostly uncomplaining wife falls prey to her grief, leaving Johan and his mistress, both heartbroken. It takes a miracle to set nature -- and the family -- back on its course. Till then, you have been wowed by this offbeat experience.<br>

Impoverished cattle rancher Dan Evans is all set to lose his ranch but can do little to fight off the land grabbers, much to the discomfiture of his young son (Logan Lerman). When the town captures infamous outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe), he offers to escort him to the 3:10 train to the Yuma prison where the hangman's noose awaits the flashy criminal. Dan may have lost a leg in the civil war, nevertheless, he is still a sharpshooter; but more importantly, he needs the fee of $200 for services rendered, since this would help him feed his family. Wade offers him inducements beyond his imagination, but Dan is an honest man. And Dan is a brave man too, unperturbed by Wade's brutal gang that's hell bent on freeing their leader, even if it means killing everyone else.<br>

Yes, Iron Maiden, the English cult band that came into being on Christmas 1975, under the able stewardship of Steve<br>

Harris, may have been around for more than thirty years. Yet, it's popularity hasn't diminished and surprisingly, the band has managed to find new fans, generation after generation. So that, in a single family, you could have mom and dad headbanging with their teenagers and tweenagers too.<br>
In 2008, the band undertook one of its longest musical tours entitled `Somewhere Back in Time', spanning the entire globe in 45 days. They travelled from India to Australia, Japan, America and South America in their customised plane called the Ed Force One. More importantly, the plane was piloted by lead vocalist, Bruce Dickinson, who literally turns out to be a high-flyer, both on and off the stage. This is the first time the band allowed a film crew to be with them for such a prolonged period, enabling the interviewers to capture them both at work and during their free time. So that, in one frame, you have the group sending its fans into mass hysteria with their high-decibel performances, and in the other, you have them chilling out, either with a sweaty game of tennis or teeing off on the golf course. Sometimes, the camera even intrudes their work space and pans on Steve Harris as he pens the lyrics and plays anchorman to the group.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, the film lights up, mostly in the concerts which are shot in high definition surround sound: enough to send heavy metal buffs into a rhapsody. Also endearing are the encounters with fans, specially in South America, where the band is treated with godlike devotion. Sometimes, you do miss the `real' story, since the film is such a hunky-dory depiction of the motley group. No drugs, no rivalries, no creative quirks...just squeaky clean.<br>

Ask Inspector Wing (Jackie Chan), who was forced to hit the bottle when one of his cases went kaput and took a violent turn. Chan lost four of his colleagues in a brutal encounter with a teen gang, led by the malevolent juvenile delinquent, Joe (Daniel Wu).

"<div class='Normal'>Very early in the film, Pierce Brosnan describes marriage as a mild kind of infection, somewhat akin to flu or chicken pox and thanks destiny for never having caught this infection himself. Get the picture. Ira Sach's taut thriller is a no-holds-barred look into the seamier side of this hallowed institution where there's so little that so many people know about their spouses. Psychologists and marriage counsellors mostly ascribe the success of this institution to two main factors: secrets and lies.<br>
<br>
Set against the genteel 1940s, this comedy of misdemeanours unfolds through a treacherous web of adultery, deceit and murder. Middle-aged Chris Cooper lives out the American dream with his beautiful wife, Patricia Clarkson, who has proved to be the perfect wife through all the tumultuous years of settling in and settling down. Life seems to be on song for this happily married couple, until Cooper lifts the veils off the chinks in the armour. The hitherto dutiful husband has actually been involved in an adulterous relationship with the gentle and uber feminine widow, Rachel McAdams and wants to opt out of his cold and formal marriage. Now that's not an easy situation for conscience-stricken Cooper who has two problems. First, he respects his wife too much to leave her hurting with the tag of a divorcee and second, he has Pierce Brosnan, a completely rakish philanderer friend who falls in love with Cooper's girl friend and wants her for himself. So, on the one hand, you have husband Cooper brewing a complicated plot which involves killing his wife, to spare her the agony of heartbreak and divorce -- a kind of mercy killing. And on the other, you have Brosnan deviously trying to abort the illicit love story and kick start his own with the platinum blonde widow with the irresistible scarlet pout.<br>
<br>
The film is a gripping insight into the evil that often tinges adult emotions and unfolds like a languorous thriller, where danger always seems to be lurking round the corner. While Chris Cooper is always a delight to watch with his ability to touch rare depths in a character -- he retains your sympathy, even while plotting his wife's murder -- it is Pierce Brosnan who boldly walks out of the shadow of James Bond. Another successful attempt to break the Bond-age after The Tailor of Panama.<br>

On the other, was a vibrant underground communist movement working towards the overthrow of the prevailing dictatorship. It's this heady cocktail of football and politics that forms the backdrop of the film which focuses on the attempts of eight-year-old Mauro to survive a year away from his home and his parents.<br>

In order to escape torture and arrest, Mauro's activist parents leave him at his grandfather's house in a Jewish neighbourhood in downtown Sao Paulo, promising to return after a long vacation. Little do they know that the grandfather has died and their son has nowhere to go. Unless he consents to live with grandad's grumpy old neighbour (Germano Haiut), who doesn't seem too fond of kids, specially non-Jewish ones, and eats fish for breakfast. Here, in strange environs, the little boy has nothing to fall back upon except his passion for football, the growing friendship with the feisty little Hanna who lives in the same building, the hope that his parents will return and the changing currents in the bustling streets below, where political unrest is keeping pace with World Cup fervour.

Three years later, he returns home, only to find a young hottie sunbathing in his backyard. Holy smoke! Is that the matronly matriach, Marty? Yes she is. Mom's had a complete make over, taken hold of her body and her life, gone on a spiritual trip around the world and found her inner soul.

And before you can see the shards of glass settling down, there are some more deafening explosions and crackling kick butt antics that shatter some more glass. This time in tons and mountains!<br>
<br>
The film literally keeps running and kicking its way on screen as three young cops try to nab a gang of robbers, led by the dashing Tien (Jacky Wu Jing), the evil mastermind who happened to kill one of the cop's fiancee as collateral damage. The cop trio also includes Jackie Chan's son, Jaycee Chan who has yet to find his groove. Of course, he does match the other two (Nicholas Tse and Shawn Yue) in their super stunts as they leap off unimaginable heights and survive all odds -- bombs, bullets, collisions, car chases.<br>
<br>
Great escape in times of drought. Go for it.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Falling in love may be the easiest thing in life. But what comes after -- commitment, fidelity, compromise -- isn't that easy at all. Based on Philip Roth's novel, The Dying Animal, Elegy is a moving lament to a lost chance of love, life and longing. It is an intellectually stirring critique of modern man's fear of commitment, even as it lays bare the more basic need for a no-strings-attached sexual bonding.<br>

David Kepesh (Ben Kingsley) is a middle-aged professor who is immensely popular with his art and literature class due to his erudition. But Kepesh likes to keep it light and uncomplicated always. He lives alone in his rambling Manhattan apartment, with his collection of Goya and Kafka and the only meaningful human contact he has is with his poet friend and his mistress (Patricia Clarkson) who visits him occasionally, for a heady night of wine and passion. Having divorced his wife, he has a messy relationship with his only son and generally keeps his students at bay. Until he meets Consuela (Penelope Cruz), the beautiful Cuban student, who seems to have walked straight out of a Goya canvas with her striking good looks, aristocratic frame and probing mind. The art historian can barely resist this work of art and seduces her into his bedroom with his intellectual discussions. The relationship grows from mere carnal desire and threatens to last a lifetime, but for David's phobia of total emotional surrender and his fear of the yawning age gap between them. A heart-broken Consuela walks out of his life when she realises there isn't a happily-ever-after for them, while David tries his best to turn back to his isolation. Doesn't work, specially since Consuella comes back, with the threat of impermanence once again...<br>
<br>
The film is essentially an aesthetically satisfying experience which touches upon the contemporary problem of urban disconnect, where long term relationships are gradually being replaced by ephemeral one-night-stands. Watch it for the rich fabric and the intense chemistry between Ben Kingsley and Penelope Cruz who set the screen on fire with their passion and anguish.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>First things first. Watch this film only in an auditorium that allows you to enjoy the 3-D animation effect. And that's because watching an alien fly right into you, a fireball falling onto you and a car driving onto the screen from behind you shocks and awes like never before. Definitely not like Chota Chetan, India's first tryst from 2-D to 3-D.<br>
<br>
Truly, the highlight of Dreamwork's new animation film is its stylised 3-D effect which creates a spectacle of the moving image. It catapults you right into the vortex of the action and almost makes you a participant as you duck, lunge back and jump start each time the brightly animated screen reaches out to pull, pummel or petrify.<br>

The alluring speed devil, Dominic Torreto (Vin Diesel), who became a cult figure in the first Fast and Furious, turned his back to the two sequels that followed (2Fast 2Furious and Tokyo Drift) due to fee problems. The franchise lost its zing and Vin almost vanished from the screen. So, naturally, the two had to get together again and create grease lightnin' once more.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>It takes the death of Julia Roberts, an archetypal home-maker, to bring together her dysfunctional family. Julia, the perfect mother and wife, lived her life, bridging the gap between her husband (Willem Dafoe) and her son (Ryan Reynolds). But she failed to smooth out the differences between them. The father was too strict and the son too rebellious. Hence, the negative vibes, which continued even during the funeral, when Reynolds tried his best to run away from his grief by running after fireflies, fishing with his young cousins or making-out with his separated wife (Carrie Ann Moss). His only confidante was his aunt (Emily Watson). But here again, there seems to be more than meets the eye...<br>
<br>
You need to hang on patiently to watch the animosity being replaced by family bonhomie as all the skewed equations are set right. Of course, you end up missing Ms Roberts who's done away too soon. Watch out for a feisty show by Emily Watson as the mysterious Aunt Jane.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Music has the magical power, not only to make a star out of the errant folks, but also to heal conflict and bring feuding families together. That's the message of this small, grainy little film that doesn't boast much in terms of style, but hangs together by a frail thread: its story of the underdog having his day.<br>
<br>
Rob (Omarion Grandberry) is the proverbial underdog who must escape Harlem because the mob is after him. His worried mother sends him off to distant Puerto Rico, the land of Jennifer Lopez, where the errant son not only re-connects with his enstranged father, but also manages to pioneer a new form of music with his step brother. They call it Reggaeton: an ecelctic mix of hip hop, rap and Carribean angst, which becomes an instant hit as a youthful language of protest.<br>

The film scores heavily in terms of topicality. Not only does it present the banker as a brand new villain, it also blows the lid off the covert funding of arms and terrorism by organisations that transcend all national and political boundaries. So, you have a bank that may be based in Luxemburg, but it funds the purchase of arms for both the Israelis and the Palestinians, apart from being the money power behind all third world anarchy. It's left to Clive Owen, an interpol officer and Naomi Watts, a bold district attorney, to put an end to their nefarious activities.<br>
<br>
The plot may be tend to get lost in the details, as you try and keep pace with Owen and Watts who cross continents in their pursuit of the shadowy bank operatives. But the film boasts of two fine action sequences that leave you asking for more. The first is an extended gun fight in the Guggenheim Museum in New York, where the magnificent architecture plays a compelling role in the violence. And the second is a chase on the roof of a building in Istanbul, surrounded by picturesque mosques, with the muezzin's cry in the backdrop.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>The film is a must for all educationists as it brings to light a whole new system of education where interactivity is the key word. Based on the best-selling autobiographical novel by Francois Begaudeau, a teacher who plays the lead role in the film, The Class creates a whole new equation between the four walls of a classroom. One, where democracy rules, instead of the hiearchical teacher-taught relationship that currently prevails in most schools.<br>
<br>
Francois starts a new term with great hope in a downmarket school that has a multi-ethnic group of students. He encourages his students to ask questions, express themselves and create self-portraits to help him understand them better. But are these kids ready to accept change? More importantly, can they handle the freedom to question and disobey or will the school discipline go for a toss in this new culture of `equality'.<br>

An intelligent film that went on to win sundry prizes at international film festivals, The Class leaves you with the burning question: Time to overhaul our archaic education system too?<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Ready for one more ode to the family? Reese and Vince are an upmarket couple who have been together for three years without having popped the question about marriage. And that's because they don't want to end up like their families, grounded by domestic responsibilities, loyalties, fraternities...For them, it's more important to go scuba diving in Fiji than spending Christmas with their divorced parents and squabbling siblings. Naturally then, they aren't too happy when an unwarranted fog cancels their their vacation plans and forces them to spend four Christmases with four different sets of family.<br>
<br>
If Vince's parivar boasts of a bunch of nerdish brothers who still want to play tug-of-war with their long-lost brother, unmindful of broken noses and bruised eyes, then Reese must learn how to baby-sit her sister's kids and grapple with her mother's eccentricities. Of course, the duo have decided to escape as soon as things get out of hand, but Christmas is a strange festival. With so much warmth and good cheer all around, it almost always ends up bringing enstranged people together. It doesn't take long before the new age couple is talking about old-fashioned values and dreaming of kids, home and a family of their own.<br>
<br>
What's missing in this film is both warmth and humour. The gags are too loud and the bonding too clinical to actually make you a believer too, like the protagonists who forget fun in Fiji for family.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>This may be the third film in the successful Underworld franchise, but thematically, it is a prequel that goes back 1000 years to trace the rebellion of the lycans -- a hybrid species of werewolves and humans -- against the ruling vampires.<br>

More importantly, the film features Kate Beckinsale, the brand ambassador of the series, in just a fleeting moment in the end. But, you don't really miss her, for there is the feisty Sonja (Rhona Mitra) and her burning passion for enslaved lycan hero, Lucian (Michael Sheen) that stirs a cauldron of revolt against her despotic dad, Viktor, the Vampire (Bill Nighy).<br>
<br>
Viktor takes pity on the newborn lycan, Lucian and doesn't kill him despite prophecy forewarning him against the rise of the species. He however enslaves him and keeps him chained with a collar that prevents him from turning into a destructive werewolf. Moreover, he uses his blood to create a whole mixed breed of slaves that protect the vampire kingdom and keep the werewolves at bay. But Lucian grows up to be a dashing hunk, coveted by none other than the Emperor's daughter, Sonja. And it is this forbidden love, unfolding in the moonlight, that forces Lucian to lead a bloody revolt against the tyrannical ruler who is willing to sacrifice his daughter too in this inter-species war.<br>

Shopaholic Rebecca Bloomwood is just out of college and dreams of becoming a fashion reporter. Because fashion is something she understands and clutters her life with, having being empowered with all the plastic money she can lay her hands on. But when the lady with long legs fills the only vacant spot in the fashion mag, a desperate Rebecca lands up in the oddest of jobs. She becomes the Girl With The Green Scarf: a columnist in a financial magazine that serenades the spirit of saving and thrift. Spendthrift Rebecca is supposed to advice her readers on how not to spend.

The film carries forward the breezy tale of growing up and understanding the world on the part of four girl friends, which first won applause in 2005. Then, the four friends -- Lenny, Tibby, Carmen and Bridget -- were coping with school daze and decided to stay together always by exchanging a pair of second-hand jeans that mysteriously provided a snug fit to all of them. Here, they are in college and preparing for their summer jobs which would see them not only going different ways, but also slipping on their covenant of staying connected. As the foursome tackle the highs and lows in their lives -- heartbreak, parental angst, pregnancy scares and low self-esteem -- the pair of jeans also gets lost. But it doesn't take long for the friends to realise that a real sisterhood doesn't need extraneous stuff. All it needs is a bit of understanding and loads of love to nurture life-long friendships.<br>

Mrs Ratcliffe (Catherine Tate) tries her best to settle in with her two daughters, after her idealistic husband moves from Yorkshire to East Germany in the 1960s. But smoking cigarettes on the sly doesn't really take her far and soon she ends up brewing a home-made revolution, helping young, disgruntled East Berliners to defect. And when freedom is really threatened, she concocts the mother of all revolutions: it's time for the Ratcliffe family to give the infamous stasi a run for their money and flee too.

"<div class='Normal'>Ever wondered what Dirty Harry would do post-retirement? The angst-ridden cop would most definitely settle down as a cantankerous senior citizen who would still be trigger-happy. Only this time, he'd pull out his shotgun to keep trespassers off his lawn in a suburban neighbourhood that's increasingly reflecting America's ethnically diverse melting pot culture. And who are the trespassers? Any and everyone who dares to invade the privacy of Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood), a sociopath Korean war veteran who can't get along with anyone around him. Neither his sons, his grandsons, his parish priest, his barber. And definitely not with his new Asian neighbours, the Hmong immigrants who are summarily dismissed as chinks and gooks by the racist war veteran, still smarting under some terrible battlefield memories. In this bitter and bleak mindscape, there are only three things that matter to the misanthrope: his faithful Labrador, Daisy, the memory of his dead wife and his vintage car, the 1972 Gran Torino which he assembled at Ford. But that's only until he encounters Thao (Bee Vang) and Sue (ahney Her), the brother-sister duo who live next door. Needless to say, the encounter begins on a fiery note, with Walt pulling out his shotgun to abort Thao's amateur bid to steal his Gran Torino. This was supposed to be Thao's clumsy initiation into the local Hmong gang which is hell bent on enlisting all the new kids on the block. But remember, there's Walt, the all-American repository of the rule of law and the righteous way of life. He not only teaches the young immigrants to stand up for their rights, but ends up learning the lessons of love and tolerance himself.<br>

Clint Eastwood reprises his Million Dollar Baby role as the reluctant mentor and reminds you once again about his commitment to meaningful cinema in commercial Hollywood.

Keanu Reeves plays Tom Ludlow, the angry, vodka-guzzling cop who believes he's a one-man army that can clean up the city, by killing the bad guys on the spot. His boss (Forest Whitaker) fondly brands him the department's unguided missile and is determined to protect him at any cost.

"<div class='Normal'>The ways of the world are truly strange. You kill a robber and a murderer and you end up being labelled a coward. That's the fate that dogged Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), a young man who joined the gang of famed bandit, Jesse James (Brad Pitt) and ended up killing him, hoping to end a career in crime. But Ford didn't realise that he wasn't the only one who hero worshipped the legend of Missouri. Despite his sundry heists and his infamous crime list which included seventeen murders, Jesse James, the great train robber of the 1880's, was essentially a Robin Hood who loomed larger than life for the commonplace and non-heroic citizens of the wild West.<br>
<br>
The film is essentially a biopic of the bandit with a focus on his relationship with his assassin, Ford, who first met him as a star-struck admirer, trying to enlist the similarities between him and his hero. You have blue eyes, I have blue eyes too, he exults, and joins the James gang in its last great heist: the Blue Cut Train Robbery, spearheaded by Jesse and his elder brother, Frank (Sam Shepard). But, it doesn't take long for the young Ford to realise it takes more than a pair of blue eyes to make a balsy hero who could kill without compunction and yet double up as a devoted husband and father and a disciplined celebrity. In a pointed query, Jesse asks his devotee: You want to be like me or you want to be ME? Ford, bogged down by his inadequacies, gradually finds his adulation changing to envy and in a dimly lit parlour, when Jesse has given up his life of crime, he seeks out his fifteen minutes of fame.<br>

And for any and every one who feels there's more to life than pushing files, selling stuff, making money, maintaining an upmarket lifestyle, Revolutionary Road is a wake-up call to break free. Or else, it's gonna be a tryst with ''hopeless emptiness'': the truth that flayed the golden couple -- Frank and April Wheeler -- apart and turned their dream into a nightmare.<br>
<br>
Sam Mendes returns to the American dream once again, after ripping it apart in that classic, American Beauty. Here too, he mercifully dissects the sunshine that streams through the happy Wheeler home in the glorious 1950s to reveal the cobwebs in the closet. Frank (Leonardo) and April (Kate) have earned the title of the happiest couple that lives on Revolutionary Road, a kind of sunset boulevard in Connecticut where America's upper middle class prospered. With two kids and a lot of love filtering through their home, it would seem like a fairy tale, if only Frank didn't feel he was doing nothing with his life and April didn't believe they were a special couple. The existentially weary couple decides to chuck their middle class boredom and move to Paris for a more meaningful life, where April would work and Frank would take time off, to follow his dreams. But hey! Society doesn't function that way, does it. Revolutionary lifestyles are meant only for the unrealistic, unstable beatniks, aren't they.<br>

That's the bitter truth the couple is forced to realise, as Frank gets sucked deeper into his job and April is forced to carry on as the housewife heroine...for the sake of family, propriety, security and social norms.

Yes, Sarandon, an American, spent her girlhood in the transit camp of Drancy on the outskirts of Paris, where Jews were detained by the Vichy government before being sent to Auschwitz. And she could never put the experience behind, despite the pill-popping, the counselling sessions, the dose of extra kindness by friends and family. Nor could she forget her two companions who stood by her in those turbulent times: Jakob (Max von Sydow) who saved her life and mentored her through the near-death experience and Christopher (Gabriel Byrne) who followed her like a little lamb and wore his heart on his sleeve for her. Now, several years later, the trio meet again in Sarandon's idyllic farm on the banks of a sylvan lake in Quebec and the past threatens to cast its ominous shadow over the peaceful present. Jakob, after years of ill-treatment, seems to be living on the edge and has given up his writing career. Christopher still burns with the unspent flame he harbours for Sarandon, while Sarandon herself must choose between a devoted husband and her lost love.<br>

David Fincher raises some pertinent philosophical questions in this gentle, meditative film about loving and living in a world where chaos rules and impermanence is the norm. Based on a story by F Scott Fitzgerald, the film is essentially a fantasy that recreates the flavour of Forrest Gump. Like Gump, Benjamin Button too doesn't merely live a life. He passes through an age in the history of the world and his reflections serve as a mirror to the events that shaped it. Born as an old man, just before the first World War in New Orleans, Benjamin grows up as an abandoned kid in an old people's home, looking up to kind old Queenie (Taraji P Henson) as his momma. As time passes, Benjamin not only grows younger, but also manages to find love and have a family, even if the happiness is destined to be short lived. His childhood friend Daisy (Cate Blanchett) grows up to be his beloved, with the two being at the same stage of life, just for a few years. For Daisy's growing old, while Benjamin's progressing towards infancy.<br>
<br>
It's a long, lingering, languorously told love story that traverses almost a whole century and ends in 2005, while Hurricane Katrina is battering Louisiana into pulp. The romance unfolds through the pages of Benjamin's diary which is being read aloud by his daughter, Julia Ormond, to her dying mother, Daisy.<br>
