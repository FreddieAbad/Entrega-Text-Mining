"<div class='Normal'>JUNO justifiably created a buzz at the Oscars. For here's a film that tackles a tangled topic -- teen pregnancy -- without getting into knots and tangles. It's such a fresh, uncomplicated look at one of the most compelling problems today. And it becomes more important in countries like India where an iron curtain is doggedly pulled down on such occurrences, despite the fact that teen sex -- and pregnancy -- is a truth that should no longer be denied here.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>LAST year, they gave us Epic Movie, a film that spoofed almost all the recent Hollywood films. This year, the target is Frank Miller's successful gorefest 300, where King Leonidas goes to war against the mean Mr Xerxes with his spartan (just a handful) army of Spartans, while his queen (Carmen Electra) waits for her warrior to return, with a bit of fun and frolic to bide her time.<br>
<br>
Of course, it's all supposed to be intensely funny, with Xerxes being fat and gross and Leonidas being born with a beard and six packs and being trained the Daniel Craig-Casino Royale way (he's hardened by being hit where it hurts the most). But the slapstick jokes are so loud, so grotesque (mostly to do with vomit, fecus), they fail to tickle your funny bone. Also, the film chooses to spoof any and everything that has been entertainment news including a bald Britney, Brangelina's adoption bid, Paris Hilton and her pet dog, the judges on American Idol....too crowded, clumsy and kitchy.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>SOUTH Korea has been trying to do a Hollywood for long. This time, it comes a bit close, specially in terms of special effects. Prolonged shots a giant monster slithering across the landscape of Los Angeles, guzzling cars, buildings and humans isn't quite Jurassic Park, Godzilla or King Kong. Nevertheless, it isn't tacky at all and does manage to make you slide back in your seats a bit to avoid the snaky-tongued serpent lunging across the screen.<br>
<br>
It's an ancient Korean myth reworked by the film maker who brings to life a pair of lovers 500 years after they committed suicide in order to escape the fury of an imoogi (a bad serpent) who wanted to metamorphose into a dragon. And the only way he could do it was by gulping the girl with the dragon tattoo. Now, she happens to be in L.A. with the tattoo intact and the imoogi knows it must slither across the seas and hiss on American soil, in order to fulfil its serpentine fantasies. But remember, the girl has the guy to save her -- again the ancient lover, reborn as a newspaper reporter. And it takes more than mere pen-pushing to out-fang the enemy.<br>
<br>
The film blends the occidental and the oriental as it moves between America, here and now, and Korea's Chosun dynasty, 500 years ago. More importantly, it showcases South Korea's advances in film technology in this lavishly mounted film that has a feel -- just a feel -- of Hollywood.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>TWO terminally ill patients discover a rare bond of friendship in the clinical environs of a hospital room and draw up a `bucket list' of things they'd like to do, before they hit the bucket. Ordinary. But if the dying duo includes Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, the ordinary story gets a dash of extraordinary. Specially when the two are poles apart and are called upon to play characters they are adept at essaying.<br>
<br>
Jack Nicholson is Jack Nicholson: the irascible, mean, impolite millionaire who has made his millions, but has no one to share the bounty with. He's failed miserably in all his relationships, despite being married four times and having a daughter who hasn't seen him for years. The only person he can communicate with is his secretary, but he makes it a point to be offensive with him too. Morgan meanwhile, is so very Morgan: the gentle giant who may not have the millions, having spent his life under cars as a mechanic; yet he has family, family values and faith. Despite their class differences, the two cancer patients find a camaraderie that sees them sharing some of the most memorable moments of their lives together, even as they attend to all the unfinished business before signing off. So you have them sky diving, Himalaya climbing, Taj wowing, Pyramid gazing....and giving each other the lessons in life that still remain unlearnt.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>IT'S sweet, it's shmaltzy, and it's completely endearing. Primarily because the story comes straight from the heart, dealing with the attempts of a young orphan to find his parents he's never seen, with the only weapon he has: the musical compass within. Like our very own Ishaan Awasthi, August Rush is a special kid, gifted with a prodigious musical talent, and equally lonely. And it is this internal rhythm -- the music that he hears within -- that tells him he will one day find his parents, who are musicians too. He lands up in New York and finds a greedy guardian in Wizard (Robin Williams), a Fagin-like character who discovers the child's gifts and tries to use him to make a quick buck. But August isn't an ordinary kid and follows his own drums...which lead him to Central Park, where he manages to magically connect with his parents, who had also been enstranged after a clandestine encounter.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>THIS classic brother versus brother film was premiered at Cannes and managed to create an impression. Maybe because its simple storyline upholds the most rudimentary lessons on moral science. As the top cop (Robert Duvall) tells his gangster son, Bobby (Joaquin Phoenix): it's a war out there, you're either with us or with the bad guys. Reminiscent of Bushspeak, did you say?<br>
<br>
Well, here the terrorists have been supplanted by the Russian drug mafia which has spread its tentacles through New York city, with the power of muscle and gun. Bobby works for them and runs their nefarious clubs, spending most of his time in the smoky backrooms with his luscious girlfriend (Eva Mendes). Naturally, he's the black sheep of the family, since his dad's the police chief and his brother (Mark Whalberg) is a top-ranking officer, hellbent on busting the drug cartels. But all black sheep must return to the fold someday and so does this prodigal son too, specially when the drug mafia guns for his father and his brother. First he doubles up as an informer, while working within the mob, but when his cover is blown and violence strikes, he joins the force itself and literally smokes 'em out.<br>
<br>
Actually, with such high-performers like Joaquin, Wahlberg and Duvall, the film could have been a cracker. But the predictable script and the formulaic twists and turns reduce it to a run-of-the-mill, albeit watchable film. The biggest casualty is Eva Mendes who is completely wasted in the all-boys bandobast.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Hollywood would like to peddle this film as a sequel to The Devil Wears Prada, that sweet and edgy ode to the Bi***y Boss-badgered employee relationship. But this one's simply sweet and hardly edgy. And that's because there's no Meryl Streep to play the acerbic angel in Devil's clothing. Nevertheless there's a Julia Robertish (read My Best Friend's Wedding) feel which transforms this routine romance into fairy tale fluff.<br>
<br>
Jane Nichols (Katherine Heigl) is the archetypal good samaritan who has spent her short life doing stuff for people as their Best Buddy, Best Secretary, Best Big Sister, Best Elder Daughter....And Best Bridesmaids too. With 27 bridesmaid's dresses stuffed in her closet, she doesn't seem to have space for any more. Specially not in this case, where she'd rather be the bride than the bridesmaid. For her younger sister Tess arrives in New York, indulges in a whirlwind romance with the man she has silently adored -- her boss -- and decides to marry him, while Jane watches, heartbroken and horribly distressed. Add to this the vexatious journo (James Marsden) who writes about her pitiable `Always, always the Bridesmaid' status in his column, and you have sweet Jane subsumed by a tsunami of woes. Somewhere down the demanding line, Jane must suspend her sweetness and learn to say `No', if she wants to graduate from bridesmaid to bride and de-clutter her closet by discarding the 27 dresses for that one dream dress in white.<br>
<br>
Both Heigl and Marsden put up a spirited show as the quibbling couple, with the film throwing up some comic sequences as an overworked Jane keeps hopping from an American wedding to an Indian wedding and ends up wearing the bindi on a dress. Nope, it's not easy being a bridesmaid, specially when there's so much love in the air.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>COYBOW Clint is fast emerging as one of the most serious directors of Hollywood. Ever since Unforgiven, the actor-director has proved his forte with meaningful cinema that makes America and the world sit up. Letters...is a sequel to his earlier film Flags of Our Fathers, where the director approaches the same events of World War ll from the other side. If the first film showcased the heroics of the American soldiers who fought a fierce battle in the island of Iwo Jima against the Japanese, then the second film lays down the anguish and the heroism of the Japanese soldiers, who were fighting a losing battle under expedient conditions. A terrific idea and a truly global perspective which smartly brings to light the futility of war.<br>
<br>
The film is entirely in Japanese, with subtitles, and the Americans are shown either in flashback or as a prisoner of war who is treated with utmost warmth by his enemies. Even Ken Watanbe as General Kuribayashi, who heads the Japanese regiment, is actually a humane pacifist who sorrowfully watches his soldiers die and reminisces of his earlier amiable encounters with the Americans, when he believed Americans and Japs were natural allies rather than enemies. There are moving sequences of battle, specially those where the young Japanese boys prefer to kill themselves with grenades when their own army abandons them.<br>
<br>
In the end, Letters... is a moving -- and artistic -- indictment of war and violence which should actually have no place in global politics.<br>

The American President goes to Spain to attend an anti-terror conference and ends up a victim of a terror plot himself. The busy-body intelligence agencies sniff the plot and send a double to take the bullet as he steps forward to address the restless crowd. But it's the US intelligence, remember and they rarely get their statistics right when it comes to weapons of destruction. Hence, even as the POTUS thinks he's safe, coccooned in a high-security hotel, masked intruders kidnap him at gunpoint, bundle him in an ambulance and head for an undisclosed destination, through the crowded streets of the bustling town. Hey, but didn't these Morrocan terrorists do their homework on the fearlessness of the American cop who can save the Prez, even if bullets fly, bombs explode and the cityscape crumbles...<br>

This time, it's Dennis Quaid who plays dare-devil cop, but that's just one part of story.

You can even view the hungama through the eyes of a pretty little girl who loses her mama in the melee, when all she wanted to do was to enjoy an ice-cream.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>HANNIBAL Cannibal sit back, Sweeney Todd and his piping hot meat pie missus are here. And they do the human morsel munching, better, bolder and bloodier than Anthony Hopkins cheek-chewing act in The Silence of The Lambs.<br>
<br>
At the outset, it would be only fair to warn the viewer that there is nothing, simply nothing, uplifting nor enlightening in this bleak black comedy about one man's revenge against a world that robbed him of his wife and child. Ethically, the film is an extreme low-life experience as it plots the moral degradation of a man who has gone mad with his anguish and lust for revenge. Adaptated from Broadway's bloodiest musical, Tim Burton's celluloid adaptation is both bleak and brilliant, despite sending out all the wrong messages and serenading the cult of the macabre. But when was cinema meant to be a moral science lesson; and hasn't the anti-hero become more appealing than the messiah.<br>
<br>
Hence, the importance of Sweeney Todd, the razor-sharp barber of backstreet London, who displays how rage can turn a gentle soul into a demon and sorrow can transform a sensitive soul into a soulless killing machine. And it takes the talent of Johnny Depp to create a towering character out of a cold-blooded killer who slits the throat of his customers instead of giving them a shave and sends them down through a chute to the pie shop below. Why? So that his landlady, the fiendish Mrs Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) can mince them up for her succulent meat pies which have become the rage of impoverished and hunger-stricken London. The enigmatic duo see nothing wrong in their devilish deeds, because Mr Todd is doing it for revenge (his family has been ruined by an unscrupulous judge, Alan Rickman), and Mrs Lovett's doing it for love (she adores the anguished barber and wants him any which way.)<br>
<br>
We recommend this extreme barbarism, only because of its artistic excellence -- London landscaped like Charles Dickens described it -- and for the fact that it depicts evil with an integrity too. There are no apologies for the unmitigated blood-letting and the tone is non-judgmental as the film descends into the very dregs of the human psyche. What's more enthralling are the performances by the lead players (Depp and Bonham Carter) who are never abhorrent, despite their vile acts. And the fact that they do their own singing in this musical only adds to the histrionic's show. Watch it, for this might be the funkiest freak show in town.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>IT takes 11 and a half minutes of the film to come up with its first dialogue: `There she is!' Our protagonist Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis) who has been assiduously digging into the bowels of the earth finds his hidden treasure: silver. That seems to set the note of this art house investigation into America's twin towers: oil and religion. It's reticent and diligent and grows on you. Although a turn-of-the-century account of a miner's growing fortunes as he taps the oil-rich Californian reserves and comes in conflict with the local godman, the film is relevant even today. Simply because America hasn't abandoned its obsession -- with oil and God -- till now.<br>
<br>
It's an epical portrayal of a not-so-nice man who grows into the archetypal capitalist, buying up all the land without bothering about the people who inhabit it. So much so, he even loses interest in his son after the kid is injured in an accident and ends up a tortured, mangled soul, instead of the astute business partner he was grooming him to be. Plainview plainly lacks humanism and is powered only by an unlimited greed for money as he bleeds the community of Little Boston dry. He dreams big and hopes to set up a pipeline to transmit his abundant supplies of oil without sharing his profits with the shipping companies, but dreams don't always come true. Specially when there is the local godman who wants a share in the oil money to augment the power of the church. So what if he's transforming religion into drama too, with his hysterical exorcisms and healing rituals....It's a disturbing picture of America's rise to power. Because if people like Daniel Plainview powered it to superpower status, the nation doesn't really have a happy past to reflect upon. Watch it for Anderson's eye for detail and for Daniel Day-Lewis who lends grandeur a period charm to Plainview despite his questionable motives.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>GEORGE Clooney has perfected the role of the tormented insider by now. Time and again, he has displayed his skills at delineating one of Hollywood's favourite characters: the insider-turned-rebel who wants to clean up the mess he has partly created. So you see him moving from cold complicity to seething anger and final rebellion, all with the characteristic Clooney charisma, almost reminiscent of what Matt Damon has done with Jason Bourne, the renegade agent on the run.<br>
<br>
Here, he plays a `fixer' in a law firm who basically sees himself as a `janitor', since his job entails a lot of cleaning-up behind the scenes to ensure the high-powered clients win, any which way. Doesn't matter if they are guilty or not, the moneyed must always go scott-free, for what are legal eagles for. So, everything's fair in biz and war, even defending a corporation that is being rightly sued for poisonous pollution. But only until Clayton's friend and mentor (Tom Wilkinson) gets the conscience call. Time for Clayton to discover the hero within and stop sleepwalking through his monotonous life that is as drab as his power suits and his poker games.<br>
<br>
Reminds you of Erin Brokovich? Right. The film has the same premise about guilty-as-hell gargantuan corporations that can be brought down on their knees by something as simple as a conscience break. The narrative does get somewhat dense, here and there, but leave it to Clooney to carry you through this legal maze that takes a detour into the character's personal hell -- his tangled private life -- too.<br>

Isn't an easy search, specially when her employer (Laura Linney) is the perfect boss -- absolutely and irrationally demanding. And the family is a completely dysfunctional one with a husband who likes to get touch-feely with the hot nanny.<br>

Of course, we all know it was John Wilkes Booth who did it. But mysterious man Ed Harris lands up in one of Cage's lectures with a mothballed piece of parchment from Booth's diary that declares Booth's had an accomplice. And this bad guy happens to be none other than Nicholas Cage's ancestor.<br>

Oops! Skeletons from the Gates' cupboard, huh? Time for the entire Gates family to get together and salvage the family's honour, even if it means breaking into the White House, kidnapping the President and rebuilding broken family ties. For Mama Gates (Helen Mirren) and Papa Gates (John Voight) have long been estranged, while Ben himself has a troubled relationship with girlfriend Abigail (Diane Kruger).<br>

Loads of insipid rummaging through history's memorabilia followed by some uneventful trips to discover a forgotten city of gold don't actually make for a thrilling adventure.

"<div class='Normal'>The film is supposedly an imaginary biography of noted photographer Diane Arbus who lived in New York in the 1950s. But what emerges is a highly imaginative portrait of a woman who turned her back to boring domesticity and found a new vision with her friend and neighbour, Lionel (Robert Downey Jr) who introduced her to a whole new world of marginalised, uncommon, extraordinary people. These were in stark contrast to the bored, smiling portraits which her husband photographed, while she stood by as a mere assistant and patted lipstick on the models.<br>
<br>
The story moves along the pattern of the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale, where the buttoned-up Arbus is irresistibly drawn towards her freak neighbour who is strangely covered up in fur. But it is behind the fur that Arbus discovers a friend and soulmate who helps her transcend the binds of 1950's propriety and discover both herself and a whole new world of free birds.<br>

The film has a slow, languorous pace which might put off many, but for those who like a different cinematic experience, Fur could end up as engaging cinema. So what if Nicole Kidman whispers through most of the film. Her eyes say it all, as does her body language.<br>

So, now the bad guy is running a tournament where death is the penalty for losers who end up as dust jars on weirdo Walken's mantelpiece. The FBI's new mission is to bust this championship of death and the only guy who can help them is the unsuitable boy, Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler).<br>

Thematically too, the film based on Philip Pullman's trilogy, His Dark Materials, has larger ethical overtones as it unleashes a debate on authority versus free will. Lyra's universe is controlled by the authoritarian Magisterium which tells people what to do, thus leaving no scope for the daemons (the free spirit that tags along each human) to express themselves.<br>
<br>
In order to banish the daemons (read free will) completely, they have unleashed a sinister programme where they abduct all the children and programme them in human labs, so that they emerge minus the power to dissent. Quite quite in keeping with the Orwellian prophecy....But Lyra is a strong-willed girl who defies the mysterious Ms Kidman who wants to use her magical powers to master the multiple universes. Fleeing from her captor, she finds a comrade in a giant polar bear who will lead her further in her crusade. But more of that in the next sequel.<br>

And that's the problem with Golden Compass. It's open-ended and quite unnerving, leaving the viewers a dissatisfied lot. All the special effects lead up to almost nowhere, as Lyra sails off into the horizon and promises to save the world somewhere in the future. Gawd! Who waits for Godot! As for Daniel Craig, poor Mr Bond is hardly there. Are we to rest content with two and a half scenes of this particle physicist who chases dust as his life's mission? Disconcerting, again.

She tries to unravel the story behind the death of a Hollywood actress who lived in the house before her. Who killed the '80s diva Dehlia Dreycott, after she disappeared for five months: that's the intriguing question that bothers our snoopy teen as she hunts through the memorabilia in the decrepit mansion that's now home for her. Helping her out is snoopier 12-year-old Corky (Josh Flitter) who's quite smitten by our girl hero.

The grandeur of Cooper's histrionics transform the spy into a towering figure, a man who loved his family, went to church every Sunday and managed to evoke admiration and respect from his young assistant, despite his brusque demeanour and suspect loyalties. So where are the chinks in the armour? Under the guise of a diligent intel officer, Cooper has been selling invaluable military secrets to the Soviets, although he pleads for forgiveness during confession. Having being side-stepped all his life, he nurtures a permanent grudge against the US government, because he believes that even if he continues giving his best for a hundred years, he will always remain an afterthought.

While the government immediately finds the killer who fits the perfect racial profile, a Syrian who had attended an Al-Qaida camp in Pakistan, the assassin actually turns out to be a native American who loved his country, ''but loved God and his sons even more''. The ex-Gulf war veteran had lost two sons in Iraq — one died and the other returned a wreck — and realised that it was not right to die for 'lies' and an 'immoral cause.'

She prowls the suburban underbelly and ferrets out the scum, because, as she insists, the American soul is essentially horrid and a murderer. Tch Tch! Ask Iraq, Afghanistan.

Homer Simpson pollutes the lake with pig crap and has the US government gunning not only for him but for the whole town. The slyvan township of nerds, drop-outs and care-free bums might soon turn into a new Grand Canyon, after being domed out of the US map, unless Homer decides to do something for his 'dome' (read dumb) people. But Homer's escaped to the exotic Arctic and is busy with the birds, bees and bambis. And it will take more than wife Marge and son Bart's bickerings to tickle his voice of conscience. It will take loads of Innuit mumbo-jumbo to bring out the MAN from the muddle. But once risen, Homer is truly 'duh' hero of the day.<br>

A great dig at all that's American, including President Shwarzenneger who says he's been elected to lead not read (remember Bush reading My Pet Goat upside down, while the WTC fell), The Simpsons Movie is quite mazedar.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Hollywood, you aren't alone now. Korea begins its film exports to India and has a long list in the pipeline. But surely, The Host wasn't the perfect film to begin with. Not when Hollywood has perfected the art of Jurassic Park. Why would anybody want to watch a country cousin of the hi-tech dinos of Spielberg's super thriller?<br>
<br>
The film captures the exploits of a young girl who tries to escape the fangs of a weird monster that inhabits the sewers of the city. The monster, a mix between Godzilla and T-Rex loves to keep its larder full of rotting humans and gorges on them after spitting out all the useless skulls, bones and coke cans that have bloated its belly. And it takes more than human ingenuity to capture the leaping, chomping killing machine. It takes two long and listless hours of watching the same thing over and again....<br>

Korean cinema, like Chinese cinema, has created a niche for itself in the festival circuit. Now can't we have imports that are quintessentially Korean rather than pale copies of Hollywood.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Norman Bates returns in a nondescript manner. No, this isn't Psycho 2, but the director does seem to be heavily inspired by the Hitchcock classic. Of course, his motel can hardly live up to the reputation of the infamous Bates Motel, even though the owner tries his best to keep up the creepy work. He not only has his inmates killed by a bunch of in-house killers, but he uses hidden cameras to make snuff films which bring in rich dividends.<br>
<br>
This time, his victims are a bickering couple (Beckinsale and Wilson) who end up for a night at the eerie motel. But they soon realise that cockroaches in bed are hardly the problem. Hanging on to dear life is the bigger and more important one. Somebody's banging on their door, masked killers are silhouetted against their window and the bathroom has bloodied apples thrown into it. Their only escape seems to be a rat-infested tunnel but that too has a dead end. So what do our victims too? Creep, crawl, cry and wait for the dawn to break and end the nightmare...<br>

<br>
Now if Hollywood wants to make another vampire film, it needs to add something new. No more of those bloody fangs on those ashen faces, please. And no, not Josh Hartnett as a vampire slayer. The boy's too sweet to swim through the bloodfest, even though he's got Melissa George (his ex-wife in the film) to keep him company.

"<div class='Normal'>This one is Pulp Fiction revisited.

Anonymous, anyman Mr Smith (delightfully deadpan Owen) listlessly sits and eats a carrot on a bus stop when he sees an assassin chasing a pregnant woman. Carrot in hand, he tries to save the woman, delivers her baby in the bonnet of the car and thinks he has shot the killer.<br>
<br>
But the killer (Giamatti) keeps brushing off the bullets and never gives up the chase, while Owen tries to protect the baby and its wet nurse (yes, it's garam masala Monica Bellucci) who is actually a kind-hearted prostitute....Irrelevant, all this story.<br>

What matters are the action cuts — and there are loads of them — which have you witness some wacko gun wizardry, as bullets fly during a love-making scene too. Ekdum Hardboiled, like Woo. With a bit about family and love.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>The Indian diaspora finally finds its voice: elegant, articulate and ekdum real. Here, there is no hysterical clash-of-culture cacophony about how the Patels, Gangulis and the Punjabis leave India, only to create Little India’s all over the world. And here there is no hullabaloo about the Angrezi-born-confused-desi dilemmas that the second generation NRI kids succumb to: an overdose of drugs, sex and the dark side of the moon. Instead, there is a gentle probing, a mild introspection on cross cultural conflicts coupled with a quiet celebration of the idea of India, minus all chauvinism.<br>

If Monsoon Wedding was a wild and rumbustious festival of India (read Punjabi culture), then The Namesake is a Haiku about Hindustan: minimalist, magical and intensely moving.

Our heroine Alice (Milla Jovovich) returns after she had escaped from the zombie-run Racoon City, only to land up in zombie-run Las Vegas. Her destination is Alaska where she must find a safe haven from the sinister Umbrella Corporation run by the evil Dr Issacs.<br>
<br>
Go see Jovovich run for her life, helped by a bunch of renegade buddies, led by Ali Larter (remember Marigold?). But before she can find a safe haven, she must combat all kinds of geeky creatures which include weird hounds and ravenous ravens. This actually means you can get your prescribed dose of grime and gore, which is the quintessential lure of this franchise.<br>

For all you Milla watchers, there’s lots to watch, including a Milla in silken sheets, along with one in a cocktail dress and boots, ready to kick butt and flip bullets.

"<div class='Normal'>Call it reversal of roles, but this is the film which was released last week in the US along with Saawariya and Om Shanti Om and, according to the Hollywood Reporter, it lost out to both of them at the box office. This, despite the fact that the film has a premier cast and a hot topic. It castigates America's war against terror, with Tom Cruise playing a Bush-like senator who can't see beyond getting into (read, hanging on to) the White House, even if it means bungling up drastically in Iraq, Afghanistan and God knows where else...Has Bollywood grown bigger (globally speaking) than Hollywood! The film moves at three basic levels.<br>
<br>
First, there is the skeptical journalist (Streep) who interviews the senator on the government's blundering foreign policy. And even as the senator boasts about embarking upon a new, error-proof strategy in the war against terror, you have sequence two, where young American soldiers fight for survival in hostile, jehadi terrain. And finally, there is the third sequence where a weary professor (Robert Redford) tries to infuse a new vigour in his apathetic young students who believe Standford and Harvard are the only way to fulfil the American dream. No! roars the prof. Rome is burning and you got to douse the flames; stand up and protest, he exhorts in Bob Marley baritone. The scene stealer is Tom Cruise of course who is a pucca Bush clone, complete with the bull-headed blindness towards reason and logic. He shows what realpolitik is all about, as he hardsells a useless, gone-awry war as essential and inevitable; America's only ticket to super cop status.<br>
<br>
Streep articulates the misgivings of the common American, while Redford raises the long-forgotten banner of protest amidst a conformist polity. It's a sensible voice, but a verbose voice. There is too much of talking, when cinema isn't about words alone. The film is essentially one long conversation, divided into three sequences. Nevertheless, you listen because it is a topical and sensible diatribe against post 9/11 America.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>He's a smalltime magician who has a special gift. He can look into the future -- two minutes, before an event actually transpires -- and sometimes even change it. But more importantly, he's Nicholas Cage, an actor who can make a sleepwalker's film worth a dekko.<br>

Cage tries to hide his gift by leading a non-descript life in the backwaters of Colorado. But the FBI (Julliane Moore) seeks him out and solicits his help to find a secret bomb that has been hidden somewhere by a bunch of mercenaries.<br>

Cage doesn't want to get embroiled in national issues, especially when he can spend his nights and days with golden tanned go-go gal (Jessica Biel) in the golden rocks of the Grand Canyon. Alas! When country calls, there can be no resisting, specially in a post 9/11 clime.<br>

And then, to her rival, the savvy new sous-chef (Aaron Eckhart) who threatens to take over her kitchen with his finger-smacking recipes and his dashing charisma that unfolds while he cooks with Pavorrati playing on full volume.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Overbearing, interfering, meddlesome moms...now that's a fondly irritating reality most people have gone through. As is Because I said so, a statement that has been part and parcel of most dads' and moms' disciplinings.

But as Diane piteously asks: When does a mom know when it's time to stop playing mom?!<br>
<br>
Never! The funny parts are laidback, the romantic bits hardly sizzle and the acting isn't much to write about, yet the film strikes a chord because the story is so familiar. Of course, Diane tries her best to sparkle as the mom who sets up her daughter with the ideal match which she finds on the internet. Only, the daughter has a penchant for falling for all the wrong types, this time for a single dad with a spunky son. So who will it be?

"<div class='Normal'>Thomas Harris continues delving into the psyche of pop culture’s favourite cannibal who rewrote the rules of cannibalism with The Silence of the Lambs. This time, the writer delves into Hannibal Lecter’s tortured past to tell us why his favourite cuisine is fava beans, Chianti and human cheeks.<br>
<br>
Blame it on the bad Nazis who not only gassed innocent people, but ate some of the kids too. Back to 1944, Lithuania, when Hannibal was just a little boy, a bunch of starving thugs boiled his kid sister and managed to survive the war. Hannibal, who witnessed this horrific feast, naturally ended up messed up for life. The only way to end his nightmares was to find his sister’s killers and chew their cheeks off. So what if it means losing the only woman he loved, a delectable Japanese aunt (Gong Li) who sent him to medical school and tried to smoothen out his soul.<br>
<br>
It may not be as rivetting as The Silence of the Lambs, but Hannibal Rising is gritty a fare nonetheless with French heartthrob, Gaspard Ulliel giving a fitting lean-mean beginning to Anthony Hopkins flashy sophistication in the other two films. More importantly, the violence is suggestive although the terror is never understated.
