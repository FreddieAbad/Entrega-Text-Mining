"<div class='Normal'><em><strong>Story: </strong>Debbie (Hennig) and Laine (Cooke) are childhood best friends who keep no secrets from each other. Debbie finds an Ouija board and has a solo session with it. Soon afterwards, she kills herself. The distressed Laine tries to find out whether Debbie really died by her own hand or whether it was something more sinister.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Laine refuses to accept that her friend would take her own life. Debbie's boyfriend Pete (Smith) is also grief-stricken at the suddenness of it all. Laine decides to have one more session following all necessary protocols with the planchette and board and ropes in her reluctant boyfriend Trevor (Kagasoff), her Goth-chic sister Sarah (Coto) and another friend, Isabelle (Santos).<br>
<br>
They do this at Debbie's now-empty (her family leaves town for a while) home and almost immediately, the planchette begins to spell things out. Thereafter, they all find themselves haunted in broad daylight with various ominous signs.<br>
<br>
When one of them is picked off while flossing her teeth, it becomes a race against time (Laine again cobbles together her reluctant and now freaked-out gang) to get to the bottom of things before they're all killed (think Final Destination) one by one. Laine's grandma also provides helpful advice on how to neutralize the evil forces that are after them.<br>
<br>
Director Stiles plays it very safe with the jump scares and there is plenty of telegraphing. This only serves to dilute the impact of scenes that would otherwise have given you some serious scares. The spirits also seem to have a fondness for turning on gas stoves. Unfortunately, there are also bits of accidental humor that you would never want to find in a horror film.<br>
<br>
That said, Cooke does prove herself capable with her role and she does keep the movie from plodding to a standstill. A scene where Laine meets an old woman (Shaye) in a psychiatric hospital is definitely one of the better points. For a movie that is about the perils of summoning sinister specters, the film itself could have been scarier.

"<div class='Normal'><em><strong>Story:</strong> It is 1945 and the European theatre of World War II is in its final stage. For a tough-as-nails tank crew in the 2nd Armored Division of the US Army, their M4A3E8 Sherman named 'Fury' is a safe haven in an environment where death can come at any moment, from any angle. Their mettle and courage is tested for one crucial mission.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Sgt. Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Pitt) leads a tightly-knit tank crew with a mixture of compassion, loyalty and toughness. They have fought together since the North African campaign and have been through hell. Boyd 'Bible' Swan (LaBeouf) is the gunner; Trini 'Gordo' Garcia (Michael Peña) drives and Grady 'Coon-Ass' Travis (Jon Bernthal) loads the 76mm gun. Norman Ellison (Lerman) is the rushed replacement for their assistant driver/bow gunner who met his end courtesy a German shell. Norman is initially disliked by all of them. But in time, Collier develops a bond with Norman, perhaps finding a bit of humanity in him that has all but vanished from the world around them.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story</strong>: <em>The film tells the story of American investigative journalist Gary Webb, whose controversial story 'Dark Alliance' caught the nation's attention and shook the CIA. It also discloses the consequences Webb had to bear for his pursuit of truth. </em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: In 1996, Webb (Jeremy Renner) alleged that the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) supported Nicaraguan rebels to smuggle cocaine into the United States in exchange for raising funds to covertly support the contras. His shocking revelation about CIA's connection with cocaine dealers obviously didn't go down too well with the agency and its closet publicists – the mainstream press. Inevitably, Webb's ballsy act invited counter-attack. Soon, the credibility of his low-life sources and his integrity as a journalist were questioned. His own newspaper buckled under pressure, thus doubting his ethics, which eventually drove him over the edge.<br>

You definitely get the point that yes, they do in fact have the kind of energetic sex life that can wreak havoc on whatever kind of furniture the both of them happen to be on. All is hunky-dory till after marriage and, later, kids enter the scene. Things get a bit dull between them in the boudoir.

"<div class='Normal'><em><strong>Story:</strong> A successful Chicago defense attorney, Hank Palmer (Downey), receives a call whilst in the courtroom, informing him that his mother has died. He rushes to his hometown for the funeral and later, extends his stay when his father faces a murder charge.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: The Judge is a great example of meticulously-crafted character portrayals and a film that carefully builds up each of the main characters over the course of its duration.<br>
<br>
The passing of Hank's mother opens old wounds in his family. Older brother Glen (D'Onofrio) aims sarcastic, bitter barbs at Hank while he is still beside his mother's coffin. The youngest brother (Strong) is a simpleton with a childlike innocence who does nothing but shoot home videos most of the time. His father, a judge named Joseph Palmer is a tough nut to crack but a fascinating character, nonetheless. He is a typical old-school dad and an honest-to-a-fault judge. He feels that Hank left his family in the lurch and chose to focus on his career instead. Joseph makes this abundantly clear with his blunt, boorish language. Therefore, the death of Hank's mother puts the spotlight on the Palmer family's past cohesion and current fragmentation.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><em><strong>Story:</strong> Dracula Untold is an origin tale of how Vlad the Impaler acquired his identity as – in his own words in the movie – 'Count Dracula, Son of the Devil'.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Contrary to the title of the movie, this story aims to tell all that has yet been untold about the 15th century Transylvanian tyrant who had the nasty (for some of the townsfolk who disobeyed him and all of his enemies, that is), habit of skewering their heads on tall stakes. Of course in this film, there are many creative liberties thrown in, not all of them savoury.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><em><strong>Story: </strong>The film tackles the age-old question of whether friends can become lovers. And by extension, what happens if your best pal also turns out to be the one you secretly desire. Wallace (Radcliffe) and Chantry (Kazan) portray this scenario.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> At the heart of this film is the aforementioned question of balance regarding friendship and romance between Wallace and Chantry. Their universes collide during a house party, over a seemingly mundane conversation in a kitchen. A spark is ignited and there appears to be instant, though cautious, mutual attraction.<br>

Of the people left behind are also some passengers in a commercial airplane on a flight. Not only do they have to make sense of what has happened, landing the crippled plane is also a concern. </em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> An aircraft pilot needs to be prepared to effectively handle various emergencies that can arise when the aircraft is in flight. However, handling an event known as the Rapture (where good people, essentially those who have not sinned, are snatched up to heaven, and the others are, well, left behind) is probably not in any pilot's emergency handbook.<br>

<strong>Review:</strong> Mia and John make for a perfect couple. Within the context of a horror film though, their idyll is almost like a precursor to the bad things that will eventually blight them.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>After Winter's companion dolphin passes away due to old age, the team of marine experts at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium (who had earlier rescued and rehabilitated Winter in Dolphin Tale) try to find her another dolphin companion before they lose custody of her to another facility that can offer Winter better care. </em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Finding a new companion for Winter is a high-priority task for the folks at Clearwater Marine Aquarium (CMA), because dolphins are social creatures and get depressed when in isolation, leading to all sorts of health problems.<br>
<br>
Aquarium head Dr Clay Haskett (Connick Jr) and the teenaged Sawyer (Gamble), who had bonded with the bottle-nosed dolphin in the first movie, are aware of this. Sawyer, incidentally, is now established as an instructor at the aquarium. Dr Clay faces added pressure from the aquarium's investors because, being the star attraction, Winter is their money-spinner. Clearly, no one is happy with the prospect of letting go of Winter.<br>
<br>
In another development, Sawyer is also offered an important study programme that would involve him being at sea for a period of time and thus separated from his beloved Winter. He cannot go until a new companion is found for the depressed dolphin.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, an injured dolphin is found and everyone – Clay's daughter Hazel (Zuehlsdorff) included – hopes this new addition to the aquarium will bond well with Winter. But the new entrant, appropriately named Hope, does not warm up to Winter because of the latter's prosthetic tail. So, Dr Cameron McCarthy (Freeman) designs an even more natural-looking appendage which does the trick.<br>
<br>
What is appreciable about the film is that Smith makes no attempt at giving the dolphins an anthropomorphic treatment. While the plot can feature some overly emotional parts, this is by and large a tale gently told with sensitivity as well as the benefit of some serious research having gone into the behaviour of these intelligent creatures.<br>
<br>
Featuring a few beautiful scenes that will probably warm the heart of the most hardened cynic, Dolphin Tale 2 makes for some wholesome family fare.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story</strong>: <em>After erasing his memory, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) is mysteriously deposited to the Glade – a grassy field, surrounded by high walls of a gigantic maze, where a few other boys have been trapped too. Can the group escape the deadly maze? </em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: Horrified by the situation and plagued by flashes of an unsettling dream, Thomas seeks answers from fellow prisoners, who are equally clueless. All they know is how every morning, the door to the maze opens, giving the best runners of the group an opportunity to map the ever-shifting labyrinth to find a way out.<br>
<br>
However, they must return before the gate closes, as spending the night inside would mean battling dangerous creatures called the Grievers. In spite of multiple attempts, no one has ever escaped the maze so far. Could Thomas be the key?<br>
<br>
Based on James Dashner's popular young adult novels, this dystopian, post-apocalyptic thriller has the ability to make you feel claustrophobic, every time the runners squeeze themselves through the narrow pathways of the maze. A few of these fast-paced sequences are bound to leave you breathless with anxiety. Tense, dark and atmospheric, constant fear of the unknown grips you, keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout.<br>
<br>
While its 'battle for survival in a controlled environment' theme reminds you of 'The Hunger Games', this has its own twists and turns. The teen actors perform with utmost conviction and are impressively understated. Also, what sets this film apart is how the story focuses on human emotions as much as it does on special effects. You feel for the characters and their trauma.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, the plot provokes you to think if 'being safe to suffer' is better than 'risking your life to look beyond the obvious'. It also convinces you to move out of your comfort zone and face your fear. The climax might seem underwhelming for some but the build-up is a sure-shot winner. Deserves a sequel...<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>Set about a decade in the past, Matthew Scudder (Neeson) is a former cop and a reformed alcoholic who pays the bills by being a private investigator. A drug dealer hires him to find his wife's killers. He finds out that the perpetrators are depraved serial sex offenders and murderers.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Liam Neeson taps into the same grit and determination that he did for his role in Taken, but this movie seems like a distant cousin of the former. Tombstones follows a pattern that you might recognize from some of Neeson's recent work, but there are many aspects that make this well-made film also quite refreshing, with some interesting turns. For starters, few shots are fired. In fact, Scudder prefers the use of a firearm as a means of last resort.<br>
<br>
The grizzled Scudder still uses payphones and is wary of newfangled gadgets. Kenny Kristo's (Stevens) story about his wife's kidnapping and murder has Scudder committed to the case. While researching in a library, Scudder befriends a homeless boy TJ (Bradley) whom he reluctantly accepts as a helper during his investigations. We also learn why Scudder quit the police force and alcohol after an encounter outside a bar led to the death of an innocent bystander girl.<br>
<br>
Things get more intense when another much younger girl is kidnapped. The movie evolves into a more complex yet nuanced direction. Grey and brown visual tones are used as if to signify the morally ambiguous choices Scudder has to make to find and apprehend the pervert perpetrators Albert (Thompson) and Ray (Harbour). These streets are mean and the overall tone is that of no-nonsense and even eerie at times. And yet, Neeson's character is inherently solid, likeable and even wryly funny at times. In fact, most of the major characters are well fleshed-out. Except, oddly enough, the bad guys seem random and Scudder seems to gain the psychological upper hand over them almost too easily. Nonetheless, the movie is classic Liam Neeson and like any good thriller, keeps you guessing till the end.<br>

Along the way, Paul faces up his old gangster nemesis Omar (Bruce Willis).</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>The Prince follows a fairly by-the-numbers plot of the angry dad (remember Liam Neeson in *Taken*?) who will break as many bones as necessary and let loose a hail of gunfire in order to bring his daughter to safety. Paul's daughter seems a nice enough college-type girl, but as is always the case in movies like this, there's more than meets the eye as regards her disappearance.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Almost a decade has passed since the first Sin City but without missing a beat, ADTKF presents the same palette of light and shade, this time with a deeper darkness. The monologues mouthed through clenched teeth by tough men in a gravelly drawl, the deliberately clichéd lines and characterizations are also present in this part-adaptation of Miller's second novel in the Sin City series. There's something similar to the first one, as well as something different this time around, again with strong cast.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>First, the good. To be fair, the film's strongest suit is the stellar dance and choreography that you will be treated with, should you decide to go see it. Apart from that, the elaborate sets where all the foot-tapping and hip-swaying takes place also look pretty slick with some fancy camera angles - just like you'd see on a top-notch international dance reality TV show.

More importantly, she also witnesses a human-like creature appear out of nowhere and beat the living hell out of the criminals.

<strong>Review: </strong>Peter Devereaux (Brosnan) is the cool-headed but hardened CIA killer and a veteran of many international espionage missions while his protégé David Mason (Bracey) is impulsive and has an easy trigger finger. The flashback opening shows Mason botch a mission that he and Devereaux are on, by shooting a civilian. Things subsequently get a bit messy between the two. This is when the teacher-student relationship goes sour. This messed-up dynamic underscores much of the rest of the film.<br>

What's worse, Conrad used to be Barney's old friend.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Expendables 3 brings together almost every Hollywood action star you've seen on screen from the 1980s and 1990s and gathers them together in a movie that has all the finesse of a tank and a helicopter in a glorious head-on collision. The barely-there plot seems like an afterthought, almost like a token concession given to the main thrust of this movie, which is really all about dishing out some good ol' school mayhem.<br>
<br>
What is complex, however, is the cast list (evidenced by the over-crowded movie poster). Ross is the leader, Lee Christmas (Statham) has a way with knives, Yin Yang (Li) is the obligatory martial arts expert, Trench (Schwarzenegger) still has an appetite for large caliber weapons and fat cigars, Doc (Snipes) is a former medic who is liberated from prison (and thereafter almost forgotten) and Gunnar Jensen (Lundgren) is a loose cannon with a volatile temperament.

In fact, it wouldn't be too far from the truth to call him way beyond eccentric. With him is a meteorologist single mom Allison (Callies), who keeps in touch with her young daughter using video chat, when not chasing storms. The biggest name in the cast is Armitage, (last seen in the Hobbit films). Here, he plays Gary, Silverton High School's Vice Principal in the town where the action unfolds. His two estranged sons Trey (Kress) and Donnie (Deacon) have yet to come to terms with the passing of their mother who died two years ago. And so, the movie is essentially about running away from tornadoes, running towards them or taking shelter from tornadoes.<br>

<strong>Review</strong>: How to train your Dragon 2 should be studied by filmmakers to learn 'how to make a sequel'. For a change, it is not just a rehash or remake of the 2010 Oscar-nominated film.

His brother is left for dead in an open field by a gangster called Bejo (Abbad). Understandably, Rama is pissed off, but the retribution can wait.

<strong>Review:</strong> Singer wastes no time in putting you in the thick of the action from the beginning, with a fight scene between mutants and Sentinels (truly devious beasts with an array of powers that make them seemingly unstoppable). Magneto (McKellen) and Professor X (Stewart) have allied as they know that the mutants are in a sticky situation thanks to the Sentinels. Professor X patiently explains to Wolverine (Jackman) that the latter has to go back in time to 1973 and make contact with a young Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr (McAvoy and Fassbender, respectively). Kitty Pryde (Page) uses her powers to send Wolverine back in time, Into the mix is the shape-shifting Mystique/Raven Lawrence) with unbelievable fighting skills. She's out to take out Dr. Bolivar Trask (Dinklage), who has created the Sentinels to destroy the mutants. But Trask also wants to study Mystique's blood for his devious plans. Among the standout scenes is one that involves Quicksilver (Peters, excellent) and a prison break that itself is worth the ticket price.<br>

<strong>Review: </strong>Although Fading Gigolo looks every inch like a film Woody Allen could have directed, here, the directorial reins are taken by Turturro who is also in the lead role. Accordingly, Allen takes on the garb of a supporting role, with plenty of the kind of humour that you can expect from Woody Allen, as a counterpoint to Turturro's somewhat more stoic Fioravante.

Sadly, it turns out to be one of his most forgettable films for he sleepwalks through the hastily-made generic action caper. Walker, who plays an undercover cop 'yet again', is not the only actor to look uninterested, rapper RZA looks least menacing as a drug lord as well.<br>
<br>
The film solely rests on the shoulders of French actor David Belle and his Parkour skills. You are bound to drool over the uncut opening sequence which sees Belle (also the founder of Parkour) use the technique to move through obstacles. He runs, climbs, swings, jumps, rolls and propels himself down stairs, through windows, across roofs, almost anything to make a way out of no way. It is his expertise that keeps you hooked, not Walker's good looks or the emotional connect.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>To begin with, Oculus bears no resemblance to 2008 horror film Mirrors. It is by far one of the most cleverly executed psychological horror films that puts you through hell without resorting to gore.

<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: McG has many music videos as well as films like Terminator: Salvation and Charlie's Angels Full Throttle to his credit. Here, he ropes in Costner for a surprisingly fun flick, written by Luc Besson and Adi Hasak. The film manages to combine elements of camp with a vamp CIA assassin called Vivi Delay (Heard), father-daughter bonding, teenage angst, humour and car chases down cobbled streets and Parisian pavements.<br>
<br>
Renner finds out that he has terminal cancer one day. Faced with this eventuality, he moves back to Paris where his wife and daughter live, to spend some quality time with them. His Parisian apartment, however, is inhabited by a family of African squatters. So, he has no choice but to move in with Christine till the squatters move out after a stipulated time.<br>
<br>
While Renner tries to get reacquainted with Zoey, Vivi tracks him down near a market one afternoon, and makes him an offer he can't refuse – nab a dangerous arms trafficker called The Wolf (Sammel) and his lieutenant called The Albino (Lemarquis). In return, she offers him the elixir of life – a potion delivered in a syringe which looks like it was nicked from a kid's chemistry set.<br>
<br>
Combining a catwoman bodysuit with over-the-top innuendoes – suggestively straddling his lap while injecting him with the medicine, lascivious movements, puns about making him feel good - these aren't the only things that make Renner's heart race. The medicine too gets his heartbeat up and Vivi tells him that generous slugs of vodka are the antidote to that. The villains look like stock Cold War era villains handpicked from the 70s. It all leads to a showdown between Renner and The Wolf at the unlikeliest of events.<br>
<br>
Lighthearted while managing to mix a torture scene with a recipe for spaghetti sauce, the film's myriad elements come together with a deft touch, without losing the plot.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story</strong>: <em>A contagion released in a test facility has turned everyone save a handful of survivors into zombie-like creatures. Major Max Gatling (Lundgren) and his group are recruited to perform a rescue operation, deep in this zombie territory, and try to make it out alive.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: Sometime in the future, Southeast Asia becomes a hotbed for pharma companies to go wild with drug experimentation, the laws be damned. After the zombie contagion spreads, an isolated city is ostensibly quarantined by gun-toting guards and the meat-craving zombie/cannibals are fenced in.<br>
<br>
However, the daughter (Jude, played by Zanetti) of a wealthy individual is trapped in this dead city of the damned and so, Gatling is hired to give the guards the slip and go rescue her. And that's pretty much the basis for the movie. One of the first among many plot holes you will wonder about is how Gatling is a military rank despite clearly being a mercenary. Does he have a backstory?<br>
<br>
That aside, the street battles are what this movie is all about, with various gunfights and gore being the mainstay of this movie's action. The post-apocalyptic vibe is unabashedly campy. But while these may just be the two best things about the movie, dodgy dialogues between Gatling and Jude (when he does eventually find her), dog the proceedings. You'll wish they'd stop the pretense of a script and just fired their guns and blown up more of the zombie/cannibals instead.<br>
<br>
And there's another unexplained element - rather inexplicably, robots that look like they've been made by scientists who rummaged an electronics scrap yard. It turns out that they've been protecting the humans in the city. Gatling manages to get the bots to help him too. The special effects aren't a talking point and though Lundgren is no Stallone or Schwarzenegger, it is puzzling to see him in a questionable movie like this. On the positive side, the film is about as literal as it gets, which is Dolph Lundgren shooting things, zombies and robots along with a lot of randomness.

<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: While the first 300 movie dealt with Leonidas and the events at Thermopylae, here the focus shifts to the equally furious sea battle, fought on dark, choppy waters. King Xerxes (Santoro) and Queen Gorgo of Sparta (Headey) face off, with their respective commanders Artemisia (Green) and Themistocles (Stapleton) leading their navies.

<strong>Review</strong>: Mr. Peabody (Ty Burrell) is a super-intelligent dog who is way too smart for people to adopt him. Sadly, his sharp mind and sarcasm render him lonely. If you follow The Big Bang Theory, you'll identify Mr Peabody with Sheldon Cooper.<br>
<br>
The dog puts his intelligence to noble use and becomes a 'Nobel Prize-winning' scientist who owns a swanky duplex in New York and invents a time-travelling machine. He adopts a young boy Sherman (Max Charles) in order to give the latter something he never had while growing up – a home. Just like his father, Sherman too is a geek who gets bullied by Penny (Ariel Winter) at school for 'knowing too much'.<br>
<br>
In spite of being forbidden to enter the time machine without daddy's permission, in order to impress Penny, Sherman grants her access to it. All hell breaks loose when Penny gets transported to ancient Egypt through it. Can the boys get her back to the present day?<br>
<br>
With its unconventional 'dog adopting a boy' story, sweet humour and cutesy characters, the film is likeable and manages to make you smile throughout. While it begins beautifully and has its unique novel moments, the second half is moderately funny and succumbs to predictability. The adventures with historical figures too get a tad unimaginative as the story proceeds. The focus shifts from the father-son bonding to Sherman-Penny camaraderie, making the film seem formulaic.<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, kids are bound to love the characters and their wacky antics. We particularly liked the funny imitation of Greek king Agamemnon and twist to the Trojan horse episode. Gandhi and his peace-loving persona are featured too. Mona Lisa's banter, with her celebrated painter Leonardo da Vinci, is hilarious. At heart, the film looks at history with a bout of fun.

<strong>Review</strong>: A film on an AIDS-stricken protagonist (who, in order to prolong his life, becomes an accidental entrepreneur-crusader-activist) could easily emerge as a melancholic piece of socio-medical drama.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story</strong>: <em>Set in 79 AD, Pompeii is a rich girl/poor boy-style romance served up with heaps of bloody gladiatorial action and of course, Mount Vesuvius, </em><em>which erupts in a curtain of molten magma.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>As a young boy, Milo (Harington) sees his parents killed by a Roman general Corvis (Sutherland) as the Romans suppress a Celt uprising. He is then taken into captivity and grows up to become an expert gladiator, fuelled by hatred for the Romans. His skills impress his masters and he gets a chance to fight in the amphitheatre of Pompeii during the Vinalia festival.Along the way, he meets Cassia (Browning), the daughter of a wealthy businessman Lucretius (Harris) and his elegant wife Aurelia (Moss), and the two become a veritable Romeo and Juliet of ancient Rome.<br>
<br>
This displeases the visiting Senator Corvis, who fancies Cassia but despite his rank, air of entitlement and imperious lines, has the charm of a doorknob. Unsurprisingly, Cassia is repelled by him straight into the arms of Milo, who also befriends the man-mountain of a gladiator, Atticus (Adewale). Atticus, due to be freed after one last death match, begins to help out the already capable Milo during combat and reminds him to keep his eye on the prize - Cassia. So, they fight for freedom and love respectively.<br>

<strong>Review:</strong> Based on a true story, The Monuments Men is immediately reminiscent of old school Hollywood films also set in World War II. The last war where there was a clear cut right and wrong, principles were noble and objectives clear. This one deals with a subject that has taken decades to appear on the big screen - the story about all the art that the Nazis robbed from occupied countries, which represented about a thousand years of human culture.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story</strong>: <em>Based on Mark Halprin's 1983 novel by the same name, Winter's Tale makes us want to believe in miracles and eternal love that transcends time and space.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: In spite of the escapist theme and a beautiful snow-clad setting, the time-travelling romance seems ineffective as you have demons, a magical white horse and much more barging into the story, making it all look more ludicrous than fascinating. However, diehard fans of mushy love stories may still like the film, given the 'feel-good' execution.<br>
<br>
Coming to the plot, the story spans across centuries. Set in a mythical New York, it all starts in 1895 when orphaned thief Peter Lake (Colin Farrell) falls for Beverly Penn (Jessica Brown Findlay), a wealthy young woman dying of consumption. However, Peter is being chased by crime boss Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe), who is actually a demon in the service of Lucifer (Will Smith). A magical white horse whisks Peter away, every time he faces trouble but in return, can Peter become the guardian angel of Beverly and rescue her from the clutches of death?<br>
<br>
While the setting, cinematography, background score, outfits, imagery, everything is ideal for a 'magical love story', the adaptation is way too convoluted and unconvincing. It all looks beautiful but you don't feel for the characters or their love, which is a big drawback for a romantic fantasy. Barring Jennifer Connelly's cameo, even performances are mediocre. The two lead actors have no chemistry.<br>
<br>
Colin Farrell survives for some 100 years to 'find and fulfill the purpose' of his immortality but you fail to find the purpose of this never-ending love story. Russell Crowe hams while Will Smith embarrasses himself by taking up the role. Farrell sports a funny hairstyle but acts well. Jessica Brown Findlay looks gorgeous but has nothing much to contribute.<br>
<br>
If you dream about Colin Farrell, you might like this one, otherwise read a Jane Austen novel instead.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story</strong>: <em>Sometime in the future, a lonely writer falls in love with his operating system. Can this bizarre relationship work?</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) writes love letters for others through a website called beautifulhandwrittenletters.com. Ironically, his personal life is anything but beautiful. On the verge of getting a divorce, sad and perpetually self-analysing, Theodore shuts himself away in his house to avoid contact with the outside world. The only social activity he indulges in is commuting to work every day and occasionally interacting with neighbour Amy (Amy Adams). Theodore is not cynical though. He just doesn't know what he wants from life, people and relationships anymore.<br>
<br>
The writer's life takes an unexpected turn when he begins to find solace in the voice of his new computer operating system Samantha (Scarlett Johansson). Heartfelt conversation with Samantha, fills the void in his life, making him fall in love with 'Her'!<br>
<br>
In spite of its futuristic setting, the concept is alarmingly real and there lies its brilliance. Given our addiction to technology, Iphones and Siri already, it won't be long before we do consider having a relationship with our gadgets! Thought-provoking, funny yet melancholic, the tragedy of an urban life is as much a theme of <em>Her </em>as is the satirical take on love in a digital age.<br>
<br>
Scarlett Johansson's sensual voice and spontaneity makes up for her physical absence, while Rooney Mara and Amy Adams are effective in their cameos. However, the film belongs to Joaquin Phoenix, who has mastered the art of portraying troubled characters. His eyes speak a thousand words and the moustache lends his hostile character that much required mystique. Heartbreak or no heartbreak, you can identify with his character and inability to express.<br>
<br>
Witty dialogues, stimulating cinematography and a soulful background score are major assets of the film as well. <em>Her </em>is riveting, unconventional but not an insane love story. If you are reading this review on your smart phone, you might already be in a relationship with it!<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:<em> </em></strong><em>Set in a fictitious city called Strathaven in North America, the film is about a series of events that follow a diamond heist planned by a mysterious hacker named Roman.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Before you think that this film has something to do with the rock-paper-scissors-stone game, nope, it has got nothing to do with that. Instead, by the end of the film, you are meant to deduce that 'rock' stands for diamonds, 'paper' for information, 'dice' for chance or certainty and 'enter' denotes technology.<br>
<br>
Roman, along with two associates, hacks into Strathaven's 'security protocol' and then uses the threat of national security as bargaining leverage when he speaks with Strathaven's figures of authority. As Roman then periodically calls the police chief and various other officials over an electronically distorted internet call, he tells them what he's really after is world peace. The diamond heist is also connected to the cat-and-mouse game Roman plays with the officials.<br>
<br>
What is surprising is that in dealing with this threat to 'national security', the cops apparently struggle to trace a scrambled VOIP call. There are gaping plot holes, no character sketches and a shocking lacuna of logic at many points. Even more confounding is the plot, which is more muddled than the murky and gloomy atmosphere of the movie. The script borders between being rudimentary to random. It is made worse by the delivery and the poor acting that underscores everything.<br>
<br>
One redeeming factor is the music, which is good in small parts. However, the same pieces of music are used over and over again and loudly, even in sequences that could have worked using silence. One of Roman's partners, Kat (Dicey) at one point exclaims 'What is the point?' or something similar, which might have you wondering whether it's a comment about the movie itself. The only noteworthy thing about the movie is the concept it started out with - which to be fair, is unique. But despite that, it goes wrong in almost every other department.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>The perfectly ordinary, everyday Emmett (Pratt) is thought to be the </em><em>'Special', the leader of a resistance who can save the Lego world from Lord Business (Ferell) who wants to destroy their world on Taco Tuesday. Emmett is guided by the wise wizard Vitruvius (Freeman) and is assisted by Wyldstyle (Banks).</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: Lord Business and Vitruvius face off for control over a force that can bestow control of the Lego universe to whoever possesses it. And the only entity more powerful than Lord Business is known simply as The Man Upstairs.<br>
<br>
Back in their animated world, the Lego characters can either go about life following instructions laid down by Lord Business, or do whatever they want; a sort of creative anarchy. What's clever about this concept in the film is that if you've played Lego, you'll know that following the instructions booklet quickly becomes boring. The real fun starts when you mix-and-match different pieces together and make something using your own creativity. And that's the premise of this movie.<br>
<br>
But that kind of creativity is just the kind of thing that Lord Business wants to stamp out. He wants uniformity. The resistance, with the reluctant Emmett as its centerpiece, soon gains momentum. But first, Vitruvius and Wyldstyle tell Emmett that he has to unlearn the rules and begin to trust himself. Batman (Arnett), Uni-Kitty (Brie), '1980-something space guy' Benny (Day), an NBA team, Metalbeard the pirate (Offerman) join the gang and together, they head to the headquarters of Lord Business.<br>
<br>
There's much to enjoy in this film for all age groups - everything from the pop culture references, the multitudes of characters, light-hearted sarcasm and above all, the fantastic script. Novel, wild, irreverent and inventive, this movie is a multicoloured marvel. It takes characters just a few centimetres tall and creates a story like you've never seen before in an animated film. Furthermore, you might find yourself humming the song 'Everything is awesome, everything is cool!' long after you've left the cinema hall.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story</strong>: <em>Inspired by true events, the film is a behind-the-scenes backstory about how Walt Disney (Hanks) had author P.L. Travers' book, Mary Poppins, made into a successful feature film.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: When it comes to creating a land of fantasy, fun and mirth for children, there wasn't much that Walt Disney couldn't do. So, when his daughters implore him to fulfill their wish and make a movie out of their favourite book, how could he refuse? It's a promise that would take him two decades to keep.<br>
<br>
It turns out that Travers has a stiff upper lip seemingly made out of granite. But when the book royalties start to dry up, she grudgingly accepts the call from Hollywood, flies to Los Angeles and agrees to the adaptation, but only if it matches her lofty standards.<br>
<br>
Sounds simple enough, think the scriptwriter Don DaGradi (Whitford) and songwriting brothers Richard and Robert Sherman (Schwartzman and Novak, respectively). How wrong they are! The grouchy Travers is finicky, cranky and an overall fusspot. She drives them up a wall each day and rejects their script as being 'pulp'.<br>
<br>
Hancock often cuts to a parallel story, Travers' childhood set in the Australian outback, in 1901. She is brought up by her mother (Wilson) and her father (Farrell, brilliant) who she loves. The flashbacks attempt to explain how Travers traversed from fresh faced girl to a lady who is humourless and bordering on dictatorial. Ironically, if there's one thing that the movie could have used less of, it's the several flashbacks. There are just too many of them. So, it is almost a relief each time the scene shifts back to Los Angeles.<br>
<br>
When Disney's charm doesn't work on her, he realizes that he can only understand and deconstruct Travers' difficult ways by tapping into his own childhood. In doing so, he uses empathy and not anger to try and melt Travers' frosty ways and to look at the movie as a kind of catharsis. Heartwarming without being soppy, this film makes for a thoroughly enjoyable watch.

Many know about Nelson Mandela's fight against South Africa's apartheid, his imprisonment for decades, his faith in non-violence.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>Set in the Late Cretaceous period, this is the story of an underdog dinosaur called Patchi (Long) who, in a coming-of-age tale, has to overcome various odds.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> After a human live-action prelude, the film gets down to business. Young dinosaur Patchi the Pachyrhinosaurus, his family and friends have to deal with various challenges that the prehistoric environment and its creatures present them as they migrate South for the winter.<br>
<br>
There’s also a side helping of romance when Alex falls for female dinosaur Juniper (Sircar). He also has a rivalry with the aptly-titled Scowler (Stone), who is his brother. Additionally, there’s Alex (Leguizamo), a time-travelling raven with the extensive vocabulary of an English professor. He provides wisdom and banter in more or less equal measure while perched on Patchi as the latter lives and learns life’s lessons each day.<br>
<br>
In this sense, Patchi’s journey, of getting enough experience and maturity before being able to take on the world, is somewhat reminiscent of The Lion King. The best part about this film is the animation. The various dinosaurs are very nicely rendered with every contour and details of skin and scale being rendered well enough to keep kids entertained with their realism. The live action scenery looks properly prehistoric.<br>
<br>
However, the biggest letdown is the wafer-thin plot and some silly dialogues marring an otherwise decent story. Alex the raven’s lines get a bit annoying after a point, making you wish you had a mute button. For a film where so much effort has been put into making the CGI effects look good, a similar amount of emphasis and importance haven’t been devoted to dialogues. The moments of wit in the script are few and far between. The odd thing is that despite being in a prehistoric setting, there are many modern references made.<br>
<br>
Partly based on the BBC’s 1999 TV documentary mini-series bearing the same name, the only thing that works best for this film is the successful melding of CGI dinosaurs in live-action (from Alaska to New Zealand) landscape settings.

<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Joe embodies just about every offensive trait that an absentee dad who is an alcoholic and a lecherous womanizer, can have. He begins his work day with a fifth of vodka, injects blatant innuendos in every conversation with female co-workers and ends his day as drunk as a skunk, pissing on the streets and rolling in his own vomit. In short, he is a cringe-inducing wreck. After one episode, he wakes up in a room to find himself held captive. He is fed a diet of dumplings and vodka everyday and only has rodents for company.<br>
<br>
Via television, he finds out his ex-wife has been murdered and he is the chief suspect. After almost losing his mind, he sees his daughter on a TV news report and realizes his only chance for moral redemption is to find and take care of her. Joe goes cold turkey, does push-ups and cleans up before managing to escape. In the real world, he meets the sexy social worker Marie (Olsen) who adds some much-needed warmth to his life. Predictably enough, she falls for him. His buddy Chucky (Imperioli) is also a big help.<br>
<br>
Lee is known for his bold films, but his remake of Chan-wook Park's genuinely freaky <em>Oldeuboi</em> lacks the former's visceral punch. Two scenes - an extended tracking shot of a fight scene involving a hammer and Joe crawling out of a Louis Vuitton trunk in a field while a woman holding a yellow umbrella stands in the background - are surreal. What's oddest is that at the end of 20 years, Joe looks like he hasn't even aged 20 days and some of the dialogues are shockingly limp. The film has graphic violence and perversion, but there is no take-away. It leaves you trying to nail down what the point to this remake really was.

Ashamed and heart-broken, she distances herself from the world and goes into a self-proclaimed exile. Clumsy and vivacious, younger sister Anna is kept in the dark about Elsa’s secret, until their kingdom bears the brunt of it.<br>
<br>
Can Anna rescue their kingdom from Elsa’s uncontrollable icy powers? Will the sun shine upon their snow-clad kingdom again? Can the two rise above their insecurities and imperfections for the well-being of their people?<br>
<br>
Visually stunning and emotionally arresting, Frozen is clearly the best animated film of the year. It’s an incredible journey of a brave girl, who sets out to find her sister - the reluctant ice-queen with the help of an adorable snowman and an unconventional ‘prince charming’. It is nowhere the ‘clichéd’ fairy-tale, with an archaic view on women. The film introduces the new age Disney princesses, who no longer wait to be rescued. They are brave, uninhibited yet vulnerable and sacrificing. While snow looms over the kingdom, it’s the goodness of people that keeps the fire burning. The songs are melodious and meaningful, while the 3D enhances the beauty of it all.<br>
<br>
Also, <em>Frozen</em> redefines Disney’s quintessential ‘true love’ theory. Even if you are not into fairy-tales, you’ll love this one for it's unpredictable and thus keeps you engaged throughout. It's not about seeking happiness with someone else, but being happy with who you truly are.<br>

There’s a lovely line that Olaf, the snowman, says in the film – Some people are worth melting for. Likewise, even if you are not too fond of snow, some love stories are worth freezing for! Do not miss out on this magical journey of love and self-discovery.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>David is your average, everyday guy who once made some dough on</em> <em>the side as a sperm donor named Starbuck, fathering 533 kids. When 142 of them decide to file a lawsuit to find out the identity of their dad, David is put in a situation he's never been in before.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> A meat delivery truck driver by profession, David Wozniak (Vaughn) is as nondescript as they come. Even his pregnant girl, Emma (Smulders) tells him to 'get a life'. His best pal Brett (Pratt) knows that David's a bit of a simpleton with an eccentric streak. Although David knows he is a loser, he is never short of an innocuous scam or two, to invest in some Ponzi scheme to get richer. David gets a shock when a lawyer tells him he is facing a paternity case of this magnitude. But David's shock quickly - and inexplicably - leads him to becoming some kind of benefactor to his anonymous kids. He goes about tracking them to prove to Emma and himself that he can handle fatherhood.<br>
<br>
While this aims to be a feel-good movie, it also serves up mountains of mush. Vaughn does seem to do his damndest to inject some pathos into his character, which does at times elicit empathy and even sympathy. But playing the pitiful pater familias isn't all there is to it. Only his buddy Brett manages to emerge as a persistent voice of reason as well as his legal means of recourse.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the subplot of David being in debt to the tune of $100,000 has no bearing on the movie other than to influence some legal decisions. Emma is the only female character of any significance. She seems to be out of his league, but like a true underdog slugger, he won't give up to prove his love, which among other things has him bringing her greasy cheeseburgers and stolen sunflowers.<br>
<br>
Based on 2011's movie, <em>Starbuck, </em>this is Vaughn's vehicle all the way. All said and done, the movie has its heart in the right place.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>America hasn't won the most sought-after B-boying competition 'Battle of the year' since 15 years. As a last resort, a jaded basketball coach is roped in to bring about a change. Can he break the US's jinx as well as get his mojo back?</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>B-boying (a form of street dance) may have originated in the US but the country has been lagging behind in the much revered international dance competition 'Battle of the year', now hosted by France. Other countries like Korea, Russia and Germany have taken over and have been dominating the dance scene.<br>
<br>
Jason Blake (Josh Holloway) a jaded basketball coach, who had gone into a self-proclaimed exile after a personal tragedy, seeks solace and thus agrees to take matters into his own hands. On becoming the coach, he decides to handpick the best of B-boys in the US and make a 'dream team', as a last attempt to reclaim the country's lost glory. But can the egotistical dancers keep aside their personal differences and rise to the occasion?<br>
<br>
<em>'Battle of the Year'</em> is no<em> 'Step Up'.</em> In fact it's a wanna-be '<em>Chak De </em><em>India',</em> minus the brilliance. Barring the dance sequences, which manage to impress but are too few, the film is highly clichéd and painfully predictable. The usual banter between co-dancers, coach trying to resurrect his career, he making inspiring speeches to the crew, their hardships and insecurities...everything about this film looks borrowed, which is a major drawback. Nothing really holds your attention, except for the confident presence of Chris Brown. But that too doesn't last longer as his character fizzles out pretty soon.<br>
<br>
Also the film's attempt at evoking patriotism (like sports films do) doesn't work at all. No matter how passionate you are for a dance form, to use it in order to arouse nationalism seems futile.<br>
<br>
Characters are not developed enough. You don't feel for them. Result being, you end up as mere spectators instead of well-wishers. While the film preaches 'passion' for whatever you do, it is exactly what seems to be missing from it.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>Billy, Paddy, Archie and Sam have known each other since childhood. Now, even as they're all well beyond 60, Billy decides to marry and have a bachelor party in Las Vegas with his oldest friends from childhood.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Minus a few aches, pains and creaky joints, retired life for Paddy (De Niro), Archie (Freeman) and Sam (Kline) is going along nicely. Paddy likes being left by himself, Archie is a doting granddad while Sam hasn't lost his glad eye for women. Billy, however, is set to step into sugar daddy territory, as he's about to wed a lass decades his junior. He proposes to her at a pal's funeral, of all places. When Billy later conference calls his mates, they stifle their amusement and are all game to going ahead with the plan for a wild weekend in Vegas. It's only Paddy who needs some cajoling to go along as it turns out that he isn't feeling the love for Billy.<br>
<br>
Although the Vegas placement is a little reminiscent of <em>The Hangover</em>, the resemblance ends there. There is literally a laugh a minute and a singer whom they meet in Vegas called Diana Steenburgen) adds to the romance angle. Freeman and De Niro's performances are particularly endearing.<br>
<br>
However, the film is more than just a running gag reel. Perhaps unintentionally, and also due to the brilliance of the actors,<em> Last Vegas</em> offers a sensitive look at the difficulties of old age and the vicissitudes of friendship that spans decades. Beneath the surface, it makes you think about the relationships in your life. How lasting are they? On what foundations are they built? And most importantly, will they stand the test of time? We also find out the real reason why Paddy and Billy have issues.<br>
<br>
Overall, the feel of the movie is relaxed and Turteltaub does a good job of breaking the mould of onscreen senior citizen stereotypes. This Old Boy's Club still knows how to party!<br>

<strong>Review:</strong> The 'king of horror' James Wan is back with <em>Insidious Chapter 2</em> and if you don't expect every horror film to be <em>The Conjuring</em>, you'll find this one quite entertaining. However, since the sequel is clearly made with an intention to cash in on the success of its much more superior prequel, be prepared to find the scares a tad unimaginative, especially if you love the genre.<br>

<strong>Review: </strong>Thor and his Viking gang get another big screen outing in a movie that ticks all the right superhero checkboxes. A quick prologue tells the story of how Malekith (Eccleston), Algrim (Adewale) and the Elves were defeated ages ago by Odin's (Hopkins) father, Bor. Back then, Malekith was after the Aether, a protoplasm-like substance that has the power to return the universe to a primordial state.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> <em>Two turkeys travel back in time to get 'turkeys' off the Thanksgiving menu. Do they succeed?</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Two 'space' turkeys (as they are from the future), Reggie (Owen Wilson) and Jake (Woody Harrelson) travel back in time to change the course of history and get turkeys off the Thanksgiving menu. They go back to 1621 (First Thanksgiving), so that they could fight the hunters (humans) who are about to feast on the birds and start the tradition. The two time-travel in their talking spaceship called Steve. As they enter the past to save their species, Reggie falls for Jenny (Amy Poehler), daughter of the head of the flock. Love happens and everything falls into place.<br>
<br>
The intention was to make 'non-vegetarians' think twice before salivating over a juicy turkey again as the film is about the birds fearing extinction, owing to our Thanksgiving tradition. However, it fails to serve its purpose.<br>
<br>
Barring the 'Go vegetarian' message, like <em>Planes</em> (2013), this film too is a feel-good, run-of-the-mill low-budget venture which should have ideally headed for a direct-to-DVD or TV series release as it's strictly made for kids under the age of 10. So, if you decide to accompany the children for this one, do expect the experience to be yawn-worthy. An over-simplistic execution and a highly predictable plot further disappoint you.<br>
<br>
The film is supposed to be a comedy but only a few scenes manage to make you smile, like the ones involving baby turkeys. The rest look like an episode of an outdated cartoon series. Even the 3D doesn't make the film look recent. Those typical cutesy buddy scenes fail to touch your heart. You don't feel for the characters either.<br>
<br>
<em>Free Birds</em> is quite forgettable and generic for your liking. If your kid still insists, let him or her watch it. Meanwhile, you can dream of a scrumptious meal, while taking a short nap in the theatre.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>Earth comes under attack from an alien race called the Formics. While a brave fleet commander Mazher Rackham (Kingsley) repelled the first wave of invaders, it is up to a young generation of the International Military under the command of Colonel Hyrum Graff (Ford) to save the planet.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Ender Wiggin and a small army of multi-race children live their lives in an orbiting boot camp. Colonel Graff and Major Gwen Anderson (Davis) see tremendous potential in one cadet in particular – Ender Wiggin (Butterfield) – right from the start. He was absorbed into the military due to his mental acuity, his method of dealing with those stronger than him, his cunning and because he is a gaming expert.<br>
<br>
The other pre-teens are picked from terrestrial schools and indoctrinated to believe that compassion has no place on the battlefield. They are militarized at such a young age because it is explained that young soldiers can absorb technology quicker than adults and can process a lot of sensory input without being spent or burnt out by mental exhaustion. All of that aside, however, it is still a bit unusual to see kids spoken to in the manner that adult soldiers are. Ender has his issues – the guilt he feels that he was chosen to lead an army instead of his siblings, as well as the trauma of being bullied. Apart from him, the acting is passable. Fellow cadet Petra (Steinfield) doesn’t have much of an impact and the bullying Bonzo (Arias) is quite unconvincing.<br>
<br>
It is nice however, to see Colonel Graff at his gruff best. Hood (Tsotsi, <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em>) keeps the film’s main message – that of militarizing kids – clear throughout. Digging a bit deeper, another question is posed - that if you were given the choice to kill someone who you know would return to kill you and your friends one day, would you go ahead and get them before they got you?<br>

"<div class='Normal'><em><strong>Story</strong>: This movie is the story of Georges and Anne, a retired octogenarian couple who once taught classical music. One morning at the breakfast table, Anne has a silent stroke, as a result of which her right side is paralyzed. What follows is an exquisitely crafted portrayal of one of the many meanings of love.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: A group of firemen break open the door to the apartment that Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) shared. One of them finds Anne’s corpse on a bed. Strewn around her are dried flowers that were once fresh. She is alone, the room is neat and well-lit. It is a scene that manages to be unsettling, yet conveys a quiet dignity and serenity. And in that sense, the conclusion of this film is deliberately conveyed from the initial scene, just like a visual metaphor for the circle of life.<br>
<br>
It then rewinds back to a time when the couple enjoyed the occasional outing, like attending a classical concert. The last show they watch has one of their past students playing a beautiful piano concerto. Then, Anne’s stroke one fateful morning, which is probably the eeriest part of this movie, is a watershed moment in their lives. The portrayal of their re-aligned equation is dealt with remarkably. It is almost heartbreaking to watch how Georges stoically copes, no matter the odds. His patience is sometimes tested - he is only human, after all - but his devotion to Anne never flags. She feels guilty that she has become a burden, but he gently reassures her. Their daughter visits often and is deeply anguished on seeing the progressive deterioration of her mother’s physical and mental condition, especially when Anne suffers a second stroke.<br>
<br>
This movie has some heartbreaking moments and is moving, but on the lighter side, it is also somehow reassuring that we are never alone. Amour treats the subject of love in a manner that has seldom before been visited on screen.<br>
