"<div class='Normal'><strong>The Lion King Story</strong>: Based on the animated film in 1994, 'The Lion King' is the story of how the life of a young lion changes after his father is murdered.<br><br> <strong>The Lion King Review:</strong> To say this live-action film is a computer-animated remake of 1994’s animated classic doesn’t quite justify its visual impact. The technical advancement in computer animation is on full display here, and it’s genuinely staggering to experience. There are moments when you will wonder if you're watching a wildlife documentary, albeit with one big difference. It’s all scripted with a story you’re familiar with, especially if you’ve watched the 1994 version. So, you already know how this all plays out, and there are virtually no surprises at all. The performances feel somewhat restricted by the realistic portrayal of animals in this version, as it leaves very little room to emote besides the voice work.<br><br>This is where things get really tricky, despite having an immensely talented voice cast. Both Donald Glover and Beyoncé Knowles have the singing credentials, and while Glover adds some charisma to Simba, Nala doesn’t get much to speak of. Still, their relationship is charming in parts. Chiwetel Ejiofor certainly does more to make Scar menacing, and perhaps just enough to remember him as a formidable villain. The most enjoyable characters are Pumbaa and Timon, voiced by Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner respectively. They lighten up the proceedings and bring some much-needed personality with the adorable warthog and meerkat combination. A spin-off featuring Simba, Pumbaa and Timon would be well-received and arguably far more entertaining. As he did in the original, James Earl Jones plays Mufasa once again to bring home the nostalgic factor.<br><br>But there's only so much mileage you can get on nostalgia. ‘The Lion King’ is a shot-by-shot, track-by-track remake which highlights the challenge with the onslaught of live-action re-creations. Is it preferable to stick to the source material, or does it make sense to change it up for current audiences? Jon Favreau prefers to play it safe here, and although that may leave an impression on new audiences, those who have grown up on the animated classic might struggle to find their childhood sentiments revived. Nevertheless, watching this family-favourite come to life will trigger enough awe-inspiring moments thanks to its visual achievements, and that itself warrants a trip to your nearest 3D screen.","3.5","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Yesterday Story:</strong> A struggling singer wakes up after an accident to discover he’s the only person in the world to have heard of The Beatles and their music.<br><br><strong>Yesterday Review:</strong> Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) is at his wit’s end trying to make it as a singer-songwriter. After playing ‘gigs’ to his small group of family and friends, he decides to call it quits, much to the dismay of his childhood friend and now manager Ellie (Lily James). Soon after, a blackout envelops the globe in darkness, and Jack is hit by a bus on his way home. He wakes up to find that no one in the world remembers The Beatles or their songs. Jack uses this opportunity to launch his career as a musician, while his conscience eats away at him. <br><br> In the age of paying tribute to iconic bands and musicians, ‘Yesterday’ has an unusual yet fascinating premise based on ‘The Beatles’ – arguably the most influential band of all time. But as they attempt to think out the box, director Danny Boyle and writer Richard Curtis seem to wind up against a wall, with no interest of getting over, under or around it. Instead, they head off in another direction to focus on the romantic endeavours of Jack and Ellie, who are both inherently likeable characters thanks to Himesh Patel and Lily James respectively. Jack realises he could quickly become the greatest musician to have ever lived, and while he isn’t able to make his peace with it, Patel makes it hard not to sympathise with Jack’s decisions. As a result, the first two acts breeze through on the endearing appeal of the lead pair, light humour, and timeless music of The Beatles.<br><br> Sadly, far-fetched storytelling decisions begin to take you out of the film’s fantasy world in its third act. The writing, and, ultimately, direction fall under the weight of living up to high expectations, leaving you with a few surprises; not all of them entirely pleasant. The best surprise is Ed Sheeran playing ‘Ed Sheeran’ that ends up as one of the film’s highlights. But there isn’t quite enough of him. Then again, neither is the whimsical edge that made the film promising nor are there any attempts at reason either, because, why bother with logic when Love is All You Need. While it may or may not please fans of The Beatles, ‘Yesterday’ is a breezy, fun watch with ample charm.<br><br><br>","3.5","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'><b>Story:</b> When Osamu Shibata finds five-year-old Yuri on the streets, cold and starving on a winter night, he brings her home to feed her. Intending to drop her back to her family right after. But soon she becomes an integral part of the Shibata family and their daily shoplifting sprees.<br><br> <b>Review: </b>In 'Shoplifters', Kore-eda paints the heartwarming picture of a family living in poverty, stealing to make ends meet and yet closely knit together and empathetic. They live in a cramped home, jostling for space and are seen meeting as a family over dinner, slurping down noodle soup and croquettes- bought from a street food stall. This tiny living space belongs to Grandma Hatsue (Kirin Kiki) and it’s also her pension that somewhat helps the family stay afloat, along with each one’s odd job. Osamu’s wife Nobuyo (Sakura Ando) is employed at a laundry, Aki (Mayu Matsuoka) works at a peep show parlor and he is a daily wage construction worker, indisposed due to an accident. But ultimately, it’s shoplifting of everyday items, groceries and food that keeps them going. And in this expertise Osamu (Lily Franky) takes the lead, with young Shota (Jyo Kairi) under his wing. Osamu creates the distraction while Shota steals and makes a run for it. He reasons to Shota that things in a shop don’t belong to anyone yet so it’s all right to take them.In fact, it’s evident that the Shibata’s are nonchalant about shoplifting as a way of life when Shota is casually told by Nobuyo over dinner to make sure he picks up some shampoo for her the next time. <br><br> <a name='_gjdgxs'></a>And on one such night, little Yuri (Miyu Sasaki) is brought home by Osamu. The family welcomes her warmly for some hot dinner, especially Grandma Hatsue who fusses over her and to her horror discovers several scars on Yuri's body. When Osamu and Nobuyo take Yuri back to the street she has been picked up from to drop her at her doorstep, voices of a couple fighting bitterly emanate from the apartment, confirming the emotional and physical abuse she has faced from her parents. Noboyu decides to bring Yuri back home with her justifying to Osamu and herself that they have not kidnaped the little girl, since they haven’t asked for a ransom.<br><br> As Yuri begins to join Osamu and Shota on their shoplifting jaunts, Shota is at first resentful of her but soon there is an unspoken bond that develops between the two. Much like a brother and sister. When walking home one day they spot some kids going to school, he tells her helpfully, “School is for children who don’t learn anything at home.”<br><br> And as Nobuyo and Yuri’s bond grow deeper almost like a mother and child, on a picture perfect family outing to the beach, she reiterates to Hatsue “Sometimes it’s better to choose your own family.” <br><br> However nothing is as it seems in the Shibata family as Kore-eda’s nuanced and complex narrative begins to unravel itself. As the film draws to a climax astonishing secrets hidden within the family tumble out one after another. And things begin to piece together or rather collapse. Through his poignant, contemplative and potent screenplay Kore-eda cuts open societal hypocrisy and questions family structures as popularly accepted. The visual narrative of Shoplifters is equally powerful – extreme tight close ups, constricted spaces, a recurring motif of food, the visibly changing seasons – from frosty cold nights to hot summer days, the family’s coping mechanisms. And as the film explores moral ambiguity, every character of this dysfunctional family touches a chord. The performances by Kirin Kiri, Lily, Sakura Ando and Mayu Matsuoka are heartfelt and brilliant. But it’s the two children - Jyo Kairi and Miyu Sasaki - who are outstanding and leave the maximum impact, refusing to leave your mind even long after you’ve seen the film. <br><br> Hirokazu Kore-eda’s 'Shoplifters' is a layered, textured film and a definite must watch. Make time for it.<br>","4.5","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Spider-Man: Far From Home Story: </strong>The events of 'Avengers: Endgame' have changed the world; particularly for Peter Parker (Tom Holland) who struggles to keep his personal and professional lives separate. <br><br> <strong>Spider-Man: Far From Home Review: </strong>Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is still reeling after the massive showdown in ‘Avengers: Endgame’, which claimed the life of his mentor, Tony Stark. It’s only natural that he chooses to take a break from apocalyptic threats, and that comes in the form of an overseas school trip, along with his mates. Although, he’s a bonafide Avenger now, which means he has great responsibilities that he can’t escape, no matter where is. Peril soon catches up to him when Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) shows up and gives him his next big mission. But is Peter up to the task? <br><br> One of the biggest tasks the film must tackle is picking up after the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s (MCU) world-altering ‘Endgame’. It does this by taking us into Peter's head, and the frame of mind Spider-Man is in. It makes a compelling angle; Peter is struggling with who he is – a school going teenager who really likes his classmate MJ (Zendaya), and who he is meant to become – Tony Stark’s successor. The plot is mostly built around this problem, and Tom Holland brings a lot of nuance and depth to both angles. Peter’s affable demeanour is now well-established, but Holland also makes this Spider-Man a more significant force to be reckoned with, and that’s saying something.<br><br> The film’s plot also has to juggle between a high-school romantic comedy tonality and the guns-blazing action spectacle that audiences have come to expect from an MCU film by now. While this can get occasionally tedious – some jokes feel a little forced and could have easily been left out – it’s engrossing under Jon Watts’ direction. Chalk it up to the performances, especially with Jake Gyllenhaal’s take on Quentin Beck a.k.a. Mysterio. The character is entirely unpredictable, made more intriguing by Gyllenhaal’s performance. The action set pieces are surprisingly innovative, especially in the second half of the film. As a result, 'Spider-Man: Far From Home' is a lot of fun but more importantly, the film is also a satisfying continuation and way forward for the MCU, as Tom Holland proves he’s more than capable of carrying an Avengers’ film on his young shoulders. <br><br><br>","4.0","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>STORY: </strong>When Shay lands a coveted role in his school’s annual play, it leads to him being bullied mercilessly by his seniors. As much as he would like to hold on to his part, it gets increasingly difficult for him and soon things spiral out of control. <br><br><strong>REVIEW: </strong>Seniors, students Arjun (Mohammed Ali Mir) and Baadal (Shaan Grover) call all the shots at their boarding school, Mount Noble High. There is a strict code of seniority and the junior students almost always toe the line, barely defying the school bullies despite a strict watch by the House teachers and the Head Master. Because no one wants to be called a ‘rat’ or a snitch, which is perceived to be worse than bullying by the students. <br><br>When a shy and sensitive Shay (Ali Haji) is picked by his drama teacher, Murali (Kunal Kapoor) for the role of Bassanio in Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice, the play to be performed for the school’s 50th Founders Day, the bullying just gets worse for him. All because Baadal, son of a movie star thinks he fits the role better. And when Murali makes him Shay’s under study for the role, all he has to do is get Shay to refuse the part. But when Shay’s quiet determination to play his character makes him disregard Baadal’s wishes – the price has to be paid. First by his best friend Gunzu (Hardik Thakkar) and then eventually by Shay. And when a well-meaning Murali steps in to sort things out for Shay, things take a murky turn. <br><br>As preparation for the play continues, Murali urges his students to shed their inhibition and channelize their anger with the thought of avenging or revenge, one of the central themes of Merchant of Venice. At one point when he says ‘Theatre imitates life’, little does he realize how fateful his words will turn out to be. <br><br>Noblemen addresses school bullying head on – and gives a very graphic picture of just how brutal it can get. And the psychological impact it can eventually have on one’s mind. It also tackles confusion about one’s sexual orientation, homophobia and the pressure to fit in. The pace does lag at points but overall the film headlines some very important issues. <br><br>As the students - Ali Haji, Muskaan Jaferi (as Pia), Hardik Thakkar, Mohommad Ali Mir and Shaan Grover deliver fine performances slipping into their roles effortlessly. Kunal Kapoor is charming and effective as Murali. And Soni Razdan as Shay’s mother is spot on as always despite her limited screen time. <br><br>Winter and the backdrop of mountains, makes for the perfect setting in ‘Noblemen’ as an unpredictable twist and the end of innocence makes its way here. <br><br>","3.0","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>STORY:</strong> 'Annabelle Comes Home' is the third instalment in the 'Anabelle' series and the seventh instalment in the 'Conjuring Universe' franchise. The possessed doll is once again on the loose, wreaking havoc. This time it targets Judy (Mckenna Grace), the 10-year-old daughter of the Warrens (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) along with her young baby sitters. Will Annabelle and her evil forces succeed in feeding on their fear?<br><br> <strong>REVIEW:</strong> ‘Positively do not open,’ reads the warning sign etched in bold capital letters on the sacred closet, holding the evil doll Annabelle. You don’t need to be a horror fan to know that somehow, the exact opposite will happen. Clearly, unpredictability is not among the strong points of Annabelle Comes Home. However, for a debutant, director and writer Gary Dauberman delivers quite handsomely in dishing out many delicious jump scares at a consistent pace. At the heart of it is his excellent camera control and the strategy to generate constant scares.<br><br> The film opens with the daredevil duo Ed and Lorraine bringing the doll home. They lock it up in their basement, along with a host of other creepy memorabilia from their infamous cases. The room is packed with ghostly goodies waiting to be fiddled with for all hell to break loose. Meanwhile, their daughter Judy is having a hard time with school bullies because of what her parents do for a living. This part is sensitively handled. But the narrative quickly gets into the action mode, as the couple goes away for a weekend, leaving their daughter with a young but responsible babysitter Mary Ellen (Madison Iseman). All is well, until her bestie Daniela (Katie Sarife) goes snooping around the house, hoping to find some connect with her dead father. Another well-executed plot point to bring in the emotional connect with a character and justify her actions. What follows is a spookfest that will transport you into a house of horrors. The background score is very effective and adds to the impact when used with some novel ideas to induce fear. And once the ghostly business begins, there’s hardly a dull moment. Dauberman throws in some comic relief too, when a nerdy neighbor - the young Bob (Michael Cimino) besotted by Mary Ellen, tries to woo her, but gets caught in the crossfire.<br><br> Performance-wise, child star Mckenna Grace does a fine job with her restrained act even during the most horrific turn of events. Rest of the cast plays along well. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson have limited screen time, but with so much nonstop action, their absence is hardly felt. The Victorian setting of the Warren home and the subtle dark colours add oodles of spookiness to the proceedings. Overall, 'Annabelle Comes Home' is a textbook scarefest that delivers on its promise to haunt, without being complicated or preachy about Gods and demons.<br>","3.5","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Anna Story:</strong> Don’t let her striking beauty fool you. Anna is one of the world’s deadliest assassins, and she’s on a mission.<br><br> <strong>Anna Review:</strong> Russian model Sasha Luss is Anna – an intelligent, highly skilled, lethal assassin. The KGB employs Anna under the mentorship of Olga (Helen Mirren). Hired by a modelling agency, Anna has the perfect cover as she stacks up kills, working closely with her comrade Alex (Luke Evans). But as is the case with spy-thrillers, everything is not as it seems. To reveal any more of the plot would take away the element of surprise, and while that’s generally avoided in assessing a film, it’s a plot device that ‘Anna’ relies heavily upon. Unfortunately, this becomes detrimental. <br><br> Luc Besson has made a career out of female-centric films in the past, and he does well to establish Anna as a determined killer. Sasha Luss has ample moments to showcase her acting and fighting skills and is convincing enough in both areas, although the role demands a far more experienced and nuanced performance. Being paired with Helen Mirren certainly helps the newcomer, especially as the veteran actress adds emotional depth to some scenes that serve the film well. Mirren revels in the character as she clearly enjoys playing a tough-as-nails, no-nonsense KGB trainer. Luke Evans and Cillian Murphy put in strong turns as agents at opposite ends. But all their efforts can’t salvage a convoluted screenplay. <br><br> Initially, ‘Anna’ effectively uses flashbacks to fill in narrative gaps after throwing one twist after the other. Sadly, there comes a point where they become increasingly far-fetched; cinematic liberties notwithstanding. This also leads to blurry motives. It’s hard to pin down what Anna really wants, so when she goes full throttle killing everyone in sight, the action loses some steam. Add to the fact we’ve seen ample hand-to-hand combat, and gunfights in the recent past to be easily impressed. The action stakes have been raised, and ‘Anna’ is a couple of years behind on that front. Luc Besson’s latest is stylish, yet indulgent in its execution to a fault. Yes, there’s some fun to be had in this bonkers spy-thriller led by a tough female protagonist, but the gasps eventually develop into groans as 'Anna' tries to shock you at every turn.<br>","3.0","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>STORY:</strong> A street artist from Mumbai, Ajatashatru takes off for Paris, to find his missing father in order to fulfil his deceased mother’s lifelong dream. But his journey that takes him across the globe, due to an extraordinary series of events turns out to be much more than what he expected!<br><br><strong>REVIEW: </strong>When a young Aja or Ajatashatru (Hearty Singh, child actor) living with his single mother (Amruta Sant) realizes he is actually poor, he takes it upon himself to change the course of his life. He spends his time after school, showing tricks to tourists in exchange for some money, sometimes even hoodwinking them into parting with a little more than they intended. <br><br> Years later, when his mother passes away, Ajatashatru (Dhanush), decides to travel to Paris to trace his father, a French magician. He rustles up a flight ticket and with a fake 100 Eur note and a passport, lands in Paris. A series of events take over to make his journey nothing short of fascinating – from a brewing romance with Marie (Erin Moriarty) to mistakenly travelling to London in a wardrobe with illegal immigrants for company. Being deported to Spain and then landing in Rome hidden in a large suitcase on a chartered flight with an actress, Nelly (Berenice Bejo). There is even a hot air balloon ride with macaroons and champagne, and a ship to Libya thrown into the mix. Yes, there is heavy dollop of magic realism here and if one can suspend disbelief and surrender, it makes for a fun watch. <br><br> While at some level the film deals with the conditions and dire straits of illegal immigrants and refugees, and brings through a few poignant moments, it essentially follows Ajatashatru’s adventures, his tryst with chance and karma, and of course his love story.All through, director Ken Scott keeps the mood light and frothy with emotional moments and laughs weaved in. While it does succumb to a few exotic tropes when set in Mumbai, the film has a ton of color, comedy, music and Bollywood style song and dance number bunged in, to keep it chugging at a neat pace. <br><br> Based on a book by Romain Puertolas, the film is Dhanush’s Hollywood debut. While the rest of the cast - Erin Moriarty, Berenice Bejo, Barkhad Abdi and others pull off likeable performances, Hearty Singh as the young Aja makes quite an impression with his limited screen time. But ultimately, it is Dhanush who owns the heart and soul of the film. With his easy charm, smile and perfect comic timing, he gives a winning performance. It’s a pleasure to watch him having so much fun with his role. And that’s one very good reason to catch this feel good film. <br><br><br>","3.5","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Woody (Tom Hanks), now in Bonnie’s possession, sets off on an adventurous journey with the rest of the toy gang. Eventually, he finds his true calling.<br><br><strong>Review: </strong>Hollywood has a distinct ability to breathe life into objects and the Toy Story franchise is perhaps the best example. This time, writers Andrew Stanton and Stephany Folsom introduce some new characters in this emotional roller coaster. While we still have the good ol’ Woody holding the center stage, the focus is now on Forky. As the name suggests, it’s just a fork with strings for hands and broken wooden sticks for toes. But the fact that you feel instantly connected with him and root for him symbolises the brilliance of the film’s nuanced writing and near flawless execution. Tony Hale’s perfectly pitched voice and an endearing character arc gives him the edge. Director Josh Cooley promptly pulls Toy Story 4 into the action mode as the motley group of toys are taken on a road trip. The fun adventure begins right from the start, as we see Woody inadvertently getting in trouble for always doing the right thing. And Tom Hanks’ reassuring voice is so well suited to Woody that he never feels like a toy. Of course, the other superstar toys from the Toy Story hall of fame continue to shine here too. Among them, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and Bo Peep (Annie Potts) get a lot more to play with, compared to the rest of the gang. Watch out for Bo’s character transition from a porcelain skinned beauty to a street-smart survivor. Buzz on the other hand, continues to charm as a supportive friend, who is always ready to take one for the team. While the other characters (like Potato Heads, Jessie, Bullseye, Hamm and Rex) are mostly relegated to the background, many laugh out loud moments come from the adorable newcomers Ducky (Keegan-Michael Key) and Bunny (Jordan Peele). More newcomers like the Canadian biker stuntman Duke Caboom (Keanu Reeves) and the doll named Gabby Gabby {Christina Hendricks) add a whole new twist to the tale. While Gabby’s character develops in an intriguing manner, Caboom adds to the action adventure despite an equally poignant past. But the hero of the film is clearly Woody, who always plays it right and tugs at your heartstrings. <br><br>What really makes Toy Story 4 special is its strong emotional fabric woven into a riveting narrative. Dialogues are laced with high emotional impact and are delivered effectively in familiar voices. This brilliantly captures the film’s core mission to humanise the bond between a child and a toy. Overall, this instalment of Toy Story succeeds in achieving a lot more than just laughs. It manages to strike a universal chord with its audience, by posing deep and meaningful questions like the purpose of our existence. And it does all of this in a wholesome entertaining way with enough comedy and action to make it a fun ride for children of all ages.<br><br>Even in its fourth instalment, Toy Story not only remains highly relevant, but also elevates the franchise to newer highs of cinematic excellence.<br><br>","4.5","Positivo"

She’s written off as crazy for believing in aliens, but her persistence leads her to the doorstep of the US headquarters. Impressed by her tenacity, department head Agent O (Emma Thompson) gives Molly a chance to prove herself, dubbing her Agent M, and putting her on probation. M is packed off to London, where she meets the heroic Agent H, who saved the world along with the London head High T (Liam Neeson) using only their wits. Agents H & M are assigned a seemingly low-key mission, but everything goes haywire, leaving the fate of the planet in their hands.<br><br> While this plot sounds pretty much like every other MIB film so far, this continuation of the franchise appeared to be a lot more promising with the charismatic and currently popular Chris Hemsworth, paired with the equally affable Tessa Thompson. The actors have previously worked together with impressive results. Director F. Gary Gray aims to capture their lightning chemistry in this film but instead ends up proving that no amount of charisma can substitute a strong screenplay. 'MIB International' meanders along the way to set up the plot, and all the wisecracks (few of which land), special effects (nothing that we haven’t seen already), or fancy aliens (same as before) can’t seem to salvage it. All isn’t lost; the one character who stands out is Pawny, voiced by Kumail Nanjiani. His thumb sized alien somehow gets the best lines, and therefore, the best laughs. Should there be a sequel, his backstory might be worth looking into. <br><br> Other than that, there’s not much to savour here. The villains are bland, and although some of them have pretty cool powers, their motivations are as derivative as their personalities. There is intrigue around the relationship between Riza (Rebecca Ferguson) and Agent H, but it is barely explored. An obligatory twist towards the climax has a storytelling element that holds promise. Sadly, it comes a little too late in the proceedings. Despite all its shortcomings, Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson fans may be able to sit this through, simply because their screen presence is so magnetic and charming. Pity they’re working with such a bland script, ending in a film that seems to cater to new audiences, rather than those who grew up watching the edgier MIB movies before it.<br>","3.0","Positivo"

We met Max and saw through his adjustment trials of living with his new companion in the house, the very big and fluffy Duke (Eric Stonestreet). In the second instalment, there is a new dynamic thrown into the mix as Max’s owner Katie (Elle Kemper) falls in love, gets married and has a baby – all in quick succession. And now there is baby Liam in the house – whom Max (Patton Oswalt) is at first jealous of and then soon enough, extremely protective of. Bordering on being anxious and fearful all the time of all the unknown dangers that could come the baby’s way. <br><br>But when the family takes off for a short holiday to a farm, Max is confronted with the wise Sheep dog called Rooster (Harrison Ford) and he finally gets a few life lessons. <br><br>At the same time, there’s a lot happening in two parallel tracks back in the city – Max leaves his favourite toy, Busy Bee under the care of Gidget, the pomerarian (Jenny Slate) who manages to lose it to a house filled with nasty looking felines. And meanwhile, Snowball, the bunny (Kevin Hart) – channelizes his inner superhero and gets inadvertently pulled into a rescue mission of a tiger cub from a cruel circus owner.<br><br>While for most of the film, the three tracks run independent of each other they tie up at the end. However, not before the narrative is left feeling oddly confusing at times. But there are enough moments of furry cuteness, laughs and energetic pieces and gags bundled in to make it an entertaining watch, especially for kids. Characters like Chloe the cat (Lake Bell), whose snooty and wry humour is a hoot and the Daisy, the Shih Tzu (Tiffany Haddish), whose fearlessness and ability to think on her feet is admirable – stay with you. As does Harrison Ford’s intense voice as Rooster and the climax, which is designed like an action movie piece. <br><br>Overall, ‘The Secret Life of Pets 2’ is an easy breezy watch that fits right into the summer vacation mood.

This transformation makes her unstable and extremely dangerous. Now she doesn’t merely pose a threat to her X-Men family, but the world at large. The X-Men need to choose between saving her and saving the rest of humanity. <br> <br> Although 'Apocalypse' didn’t live up to expectations after 'Days of Future Past', it managed to show us how powerful Jean Grey can be. 'Dark Phoenix' further builds on that, and yet the stakes feel slightly compromised. Sure, the world is at risk again, but not quite enough is done to make you care about the consequences. This is probably because we didn’t spend too much time getting to know the new characters, mainly Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), Cyclops (Tye Sheridan), Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and Storm (Alexandra Shipp). Now we’re suddenly meant to care about them, particularly Jean Grey, over the course of this one film. <br> <br> Meanwhile, the more established heroes that we’ve connected to, Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), Magneto (Michael Fassbender), Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), and even the surprise fan favourite Quicksilver (Evan Peters), all seem to take a back seat when it comes to character arcs and narratives. Yes, they all have their moments, but they’re fleeting at best. All the actors have given solid performances, even with the limited material. Michael Fassbender gets the raw end of the bargain with Magneto, and yet, Fassbender really sells it. Same goes with James McAvoy, although this is probably the weakest version we’ve seen of Charles Xavier, and yet James McAvoy, is reliable as always. Sophie Turner has a fair amount of screen-time, and she brings the right amount of pathos to Jean Grey that helps move the film along.<br> <br> The biggest problem in this film is its villain whose motives are pretty run of the mill – destroy this world to rebuild it in their own way. It's neither new nor exciting. Action wise, there are a few fun moments, but nothing memorable, especially with a third act that appears to be quite rushed. What could have been a big surprise twist with a lot more impact is ruined in the trailers thanks to lazy marketing. The weak screenplay and script weigh down the characters with some clunky dialogue. Despite good performances, 'Dark Phoenix' is a letdown for several reasons, least of all because the female characters in this film take prominence, and they deserve better.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Rocketman Story: </strong>An epic musical fantasy about the incredible story of Elton John's breakthrough years.<br> <br> <strong>Rocketman Review:</strong> Before he became the flamboyant piano legend & international superstar Sir Elton John, he was a shy boy named Reginald Dwight. ‘Rocketman’ explores his formative years, tracing his origins through his music, as he began his journey into one of the most iconic artists of our time. Played by Taron Egerton, we discover how some of his biggest hits came to life through his collaborations with his best friend, Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell). As Elton John defined his stage personality over his years of success, the film highlights how Reginald Dwight’s problems manifested in various forms of addiction.<br><br> Director Dexter Fletcher knows that musical biopics are meant to offer insight into the mindset and psyche of what makes an artist tick. He presents the far-from-perfect life of Elton John in all its flawed, yet fabulous glory, without skimming over the parts that most others would rather forget. The film starts with the celebrated performer in rehab, dressed in a devilish costume, baring his demons to a group of strangers, as he begins to reminisce about his colourful life. This perfectly sets the tone for the film to make it clear this is not a fairy-tale sing-along. From there on out, the discography of Elton John’s career is used to fuel the narrative structure, while never being overbearing because it stays focused on its subject. <br><br> But that wouldn’t be as effective without Taron Egerton’s commitment to the lead role. He completely immerses himself into character, crooning Elton John’s hit singles that bring more credibility to the role beyond just a strong resemblance. Egerton also handles the emotionally heavy scenes with grace, particularly seen in the rockstar’s torrid affair with his manager John Reid (Richard Madden) and the estranged relationship with his parents, played by Bryce Dallas Howard and Steven Mackintosh. Their performances are certainly remarkable, but none more so than Jamie Bell as Bernie – Elton’s longstanding friend and songwriting partner. It’s impossible not to feel the soul of the music they created, which, if they weren’t massive hits already, are further elevated by their portrayals in this film. Similarly, ‘Rocketman’ raises the bar of what can be achieved in a musical biography. Rest assured this won’t be forgotten any time soon, certainly not during awards season. <br>","4.0","Positivo"

"<div class='Normal'><b>Long Shot Story: </b>A free-spirited journalist, Fred Flarsky (Seth Rogen) reconnects with his childhood crush and babysitter Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron), now one of the most influential people in the world.<br><br><strong>Long Shot Review: </strong>She’s the U.S. Secretary of State – ambitious, intelligent, and talented. Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron) is the perfect combination of beauty with brains. She aims to run for President of the United States and she wants to get there by actually making a difference. He’s a pot-loving, rule-breaking journalist who believes in defying big corporations, and the government. When Fred Flarsky (Seth Rogen) learns that the newspaper he works for is bought by a media mogul he despises, his obvious choice is to quit. Fred and Charlotte meet at a party and realise they know each other from childhood. Despite having little in common, Charlotte instinctively decides to hire Fred as her new speech writer. During their time together, they discover their feelings for each other to the dismay of Charlotte’s staff because of how it impacts her ambitions. <br><br> The notion of Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron as an odd couple is as unusual as it gets, and yet, it works. Charlize Theron has proven time and again that she’s capable of taking on practically any genre. She shuffles from a calm and collected woman-in-charge to a zany, carefree party girl (at least in one scene) with ease. But this oddball romantic comedy is Seth Rogen’s forte. He knows exactly how to ramp his socially awkward, unfiltered, inappropriate loudmouth gimmick up a notch, and then bring it down to sensitive man-child levels. What’s most compelling is how both actors work with each other’s strengths resulting in an effective comedic pairing. <br><br> They are helped by a stellar support cast with the likes of Andy Serkis, Alexander Skarsgård, and Bob Odenkirk in small but essential roles. However, O'Shea Jackson Jr., Ravi Patel and June Diane Raphael play great supporting characters that serve to enhance Charlotte and Fred’s chemistry, regardless of how unlikely that might initially appear. This is what carries most of the film through some murky waters, and even a climax that is a bit hard on the rom-com nose. Under Jonathan Levine’s direction, the film also takes the opportunity to address the gender-biased scrutiny and criticism faced by women in power, and why they need to work harder than their male counterparts to be merely ‘likeable’. Beyond satire that’s anything but politically correct, ‘Long Shot’ is a definite crowd-pleaser with its heart in the right place.<br><br>","3.5","Positivo"

Discovered by Tori (Elizabeth Banks) and Kyle Breyer (David Denman), a childless couple living in Brightburn, USA, they raise the boy as their own. As Brandon (Jackson A. Dunn) gets older, he discovers he has superhuman abilities. But despite his parents’ best efforts, he begins to show disturbing behaviour as he exploits his powers. ‘Brightburn’ flips the script on comic book origins to look at how a supervillain can come to be. Producer James Gunn is best known for his work on ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’ 1 & 2, so he’s more than familiar with superhero storytelling and what makes it work. Writers Mark and Brian Gunn, James’ brother and cousin respectively, draw from comic book lore, to create an exciting setup. <br><br> What dictates the moral compass of a superior alien being, clearly physically and intellectually advanced than humans? Based on what we’ve seen so far in superhero origin films, that’s mostly attributed to upbringing. But Tori and Kyle Breyer aren’t bad parents. They do their best to provide Brandon with a loving and caring environment. It just seems there’s little room for compassion in Brandon’s alien genetic makeup, and once his powers are triggered by puberty, his true nature is unleashed. Director David Yarovesky then takes Brandon’s abilities to the nth degree and allows him to wreak havoc. There’s proof of concept, backed up by decent performances, especially by Elizabeth Banks who is great as a mother battling with the knowledge that her adopted son could be pure evil. <br><br> But its execution leaves us wanting more. Sure, there are ample jump scares and gore to justify being a horror flick. Sadly, it also chooses to be predictable in that department, telegraphing most of its shocks. The rest of the cast is mostly expendable, and their characters are treated as such, often making questionable choices for the sake of pushing the story to the next alarming visual. The screenplay takes off on that path, causing narrative mayhem along the way. The film often takes itself too seriously, and one wonders if a more accomplished director, perhaps James Gunn himself, could flesh out deeper character revelations warranted by such a premise, with dark humour thrown in for good measure. ‘Brightburn’ proves there’s more to the superhero genre if seen from a different perspective but does little else.<br><br><br>","3.0","Positivo"

The fresh pairing of Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott works and is a welcome surprise as the duo share an amazing chemistry on screen and pretty much hold on to the likeability factors of their respective characters till the very end. Will Smith, the Genie, is a straight up natural as far as tickling our funny bones is concerned but again, it would be criminal to compare him to Robbin Williams’s 1992 act in the original movie as the standards set by the late actor-comedian are pretty high.<br><br>Jafar – the vengeful villain – is so bad in the movie that he’s actually good, and brownie points to director Guy Ritchie for fully exploring and bringing to light the twisted psyche of this greed-filled character, which ultimately makes you wonder – who’s the sinner and who has been sinned against.<br><br>However, the downside of the whole direction process is that it is somewhat mixed and some of the song-dance sequences look & feel forced and could have been avoided. Despite its grandeur and larger-than-life cinematography-animation, at two hours and eight minutes – the film starts to feel bit of a drag. The momentum, at which the film moves, is yet another problem that cannot be overlooked – all the characters are given ample time and attention to grow and develop, while the ending is wrapped up in a tearing hurry.<br><br>Kids born in the 90s, who have watched the cartoon version of this story, will find ‘Aladdin’ a bit too hard to get accustomed to in the beginning, but otherwise, the film – sans its minor hiccups – is congenial and establishes the ‘feel-good’ factor from frame one and maintains it till the curtains are drawn.<br><br>","3.5","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>STORY:</strong> When two totally opposite con artists Josephine and Penny cross paths they eventually join hands together to rake in even bigger spoils. But to what extent will they be able to pull off their scams? <br><br> <strong>REVIEW:</strong> 'The Hustle' stars Anne Hathaway as Josephine Chesterfield, an elegant, sophisticated con artist who swindles rich men in the French town of ‘Beaumont Sur Mer’. Rebel Wilson is the socially awkward Penny who makes her way here to do her own share of scamming. But Josephine wants no interference in a place she believes is solely her area of operation and does all she can to get Penny out of the way. Which proves to be tougher than she thought. Eventually, as a last resort she takes Penny under her wing to teach her a few tricks of her trade and together they pull off a series of scams conning rich men, using Josephine’s mantra of “exploiting men’s inability to imagine a woman is cleverer than they are.” <br><br> The film is a remake of the 1988 comedy, 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' with a gender switch (which in turn was remade from the 1964 film, 'Bedtime Story'). Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson here are to what Michael Caine and Steve Martin were in the 80’s film. And while this gender switch could have translated into a swish female centric comedy, except for the fact that it simply doesn’t take off. The humour falls flat - there are very few laugh out loud moments and some are just cringe worthy. The storyline pretty much sticks to that of 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' so there is nothing new there. At just one and half hours this one feels like a drag after a point. <br><br> Of course, Anne Hathaway looks ravishing in almost every frame with a wardrobe to die for. And she pulls off the snooty con woman act with an enviable high maintainence lifestyle rather well. Alex Sharp as Thomas Westerberg, an American tech wizard and billionaire is likeable. Rebel Wilson shoulders most of the responsibility for elucidating the laughter but it simply doesn’t cut ice beyond a few slapstick moments and some jokes. Josephine and Penny’s face offs reduce to bringing each other down and it goes a bit <em>ho hum</em> from there. <br><br> Director Chris Addison could have pushed this female version of 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' to another level with all the ingredients at his disposal but it simply fails to touch that mark. <br>","2.5","Negativo"

Bruce Cameron’s 2010 novel A Dog’s Purpose, this film too follows a dog named Bailey and his journey through several lives via reincarnation and how he chases his purpose through each of his lives. <br><br>It all begins with Bailey aka the big boss as his loving owner Ethan (Dennis Quaid) calls him, and he observing his family fall apart. When Bailey is finally put to sleep, Ethan hopes that he’d return to look after CJ, his granddaughter, just the way he has looked after him. After Bailey is reborn as Max, Molly and more, he keeps looking for CJ and ways to make her happy as Ethan had asked him to. <br><br>A dog’s journey has some heartwarming moments exuding unconditional love and loyalty as expected. Dog lovers in particular will need to carry tissues as this one’s a total tearjerker for them. However, the film ceases to go beyond the sentimental cliches. As seen through the eyes of a dog, as he narrates the story, beyond a point, it all gets repetitive and thus exhausting. <br><br>As the dog keeps reliving his purpose, you lose a sense of wonder and are prepared for what to expect.

In times of social media cynicism, Dennis Quaid, Henry Lau and Kathryn Prescott show you what it feels like to love and be loved in return. <br><br>Given the nature of the film, if you are fine with mushy love stories that play on a loop, you won’t mind embarking on this journey. However, unlike Marley & Me, this one’s a bit predictable and thus falls short of tugging at your heart strings.<br>","3.0","Positivo"

Now on the run with a price tag of 14 million dollars, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) must fend for himself yet again, as all the assassins and hit men/women in the world are gunning for him. The ‘John Wick’ series continues to expand on the universe it established in the previous two films by introducing a whole new set of characters along with some returning vital players. <br><br> Ian McShane & Lance Reddick reprise their roles as Winston & Charon respectively, with the latter doing a lot more than merely serving guests at the concierge. Watch out for Silat masters Cecep Arif Rahman & Yayan Ruhian in arguably one of the most stunning pieces of fight choreography seen in this series so far, and that’s an extremely high bar to meet. Mark Dacascos is more than capable of going toe-to-toe with the best martial artists. He lends so much charisma to Zero that he often ends up being a scene-stealer while gracing the film with yet another breathless and nail-biting sequence. Asia Kate Dillon is menacing as the Adjudicator of the High Table and makes her presence felt. But the real MVP amongst all the new characters is Halle Berry as Sofia, a dog-loving assassin and John’s old friend. It’s safe to say her hounds redeem the death of the puppy which started this whole series, much to the delight of canine-lovers.<br><br> Driven by the notion of rules and consequences, the plot is standard and straightforward, so don’t expect anything more profound than what you see. But ‘Parabellum’ more than makes up for what it lacks in depth, with stunning visuals and captivating action. There’s little sense to the proceedings, and yet, you’ll be so utterly gobsmacked by the beauty in destruction, that logic won’t matter. Keanu Reeves puts in the hard work to allow for long takes and steady camerawork to make each dynamic movement register with impact. Helmed by director Chad Stahelski again after ‘John Wick 2’, ‘Parabellum’ plays to the actor’s strengths, allowing him to do what he does best. If the makers maintain this level of masterful execution, Keanu Reeves can continue to play this violent & virtually indestructible killing machine, and action lovers will gladly lap it up till the end of time. ‘Parabellum’ is an essential entry to this series and one that cannot be missed.<br>","4.0","Positivo"

But their hopes to start a family in their dream home are invaded by the constant presence of their shadowy homeowner (Dennis Quaid) with severe boundary issues.<br><br> <b>REVIEW:</b> What happens when there are more rooms in the house than people? That is the question many Hollywood films of this genre have answered before. Director Deon Taylor’s ‘The Intruder’ follows a similar route with a very limited number of characters, but at least, one of whom will stay with you much after the film is over. And no points for guessing, it is the intruder himself – Dennis Quaid, who single-handedly lifts this otherwise predictable and mediocre film into a scare fest. Quaid is so believably unplugged in his portrayal of the man obsessed with his home that he makes you forgive the many clichés. Of course, he enjoys the best writing amongst the cast, with shades that are evident from the start, but unravel slowly and mystifyingly. Quaid’s measured expressions and fit body compliment his character’s visceral traits that help him pull off a delightfully menacing act.<br><br> In contrast, Meagan Good’s character comes off as a bit of a stretch, unaware of the looming threat despite such telltale signs. Good is a good actor (pun intended), but despite her best efforts, the character never seems very convincing. Micheal Ealy, on the other hand, gets a reasonably decent arc to follow. That of a husband, who goes the extra mile to ensure his wife is happy, even if it means doing things that go against his basic instincts. Writer David Loughery keeps the proceedings paced out with regular shout-at-the-screen scares, but it’s the predictability of the plot that often kills the fun. Thankfully, the makers have tried some new hacks in execution that somehow build tension. However, what eventually goes against ‘The Intruder’ are the clichés and lack of any substantial build up to the characters and their back stories. There are cursory references, but the director never shows any genuine interest in exploring them. Consequently, the viewer is often left wondering with a few nagging questions about the characters and their behaviour. Since the plot itself moves on probable lines, it does feel a bit dragged.<br><br> If you’re a fan of the genre, you would have seen better and far worse than ‘The Intruder’. It falls somewhere in the middle, letting you enjoy the scares without explicit blood and gore, but also showing you what you might already know.<br>","3.0","Positivo"

Tim's ability to understand the wise-cracking little Pokémon leads them to work together in search of Tim’s father, Harry. Tim and Pikachu begin to uncover the strange world of Pokémon and the larger scheme at play in Ryme City.<br><br>The absurd, yet adorable set of live-action characters from the anime Pokémon universe took the gaming world by storm in the mid-90s. The massive success of the games lead to expansions into TV series, comic books and animated films, so it shouldn’t come to anyone’s surprise that it’s the latest attempt by a film studio to convert the franchise into a movie universe. It’s a pretty bold move by Warner Bros. to introduce us to such a ridiculous premise, but the risk pays off. Chalk it down mostly to the endearing title character Pikachu, played by the actor at his irreverent best – Ryan Reynolds. He infuses the tiny, yellow, rodent-like creature with a distinct personality that instantly draws you into the film. The best scenes involve Pikachu bringing in Reynolds’ trademark impromptu humour and witty dialogue with both his Pokémon counterparts & humans. <br><br>This helps keep the film’s charming energy afloat, mainly because most of the human roles are quite bland. It’s no fault of the cast; Justice Smith is pretty good as Tim Goodman, but we don’t feel as much for his quest even though it is integral to the plot. The same can easily be said about the rest of the humans. Fortunately, the world of Ryme City is so well realised as a place that captures your imagination, making you wish it existed. The production design and visual effects are virtually seamless, and never take you out of the film, which is a massive advantage. Whether that’s enough to distract you from a clumsy plot and screenplay, depends on how much of a fan you are of the franchise. But Reynolds and director Rob Letterman manage to keep you entertained enough in this fun popcorn film, and might just be enough to convert young non-fans into Pokémon trainers.<br>","3.5","Positivo"

However, Bella escapes from there to begin an adventurous journey back home to Lucas.</p><p>A majority of the acting, as it were, is left up to the voice work by Bryce Dallas Howard, who carries most of the film by herself. It’s easy to forget the person behind Bella’s vocal performance because Dallas Howard makes Bella incredibly endearing while capturing the inner thoughts of a pet dog. Thus, we’re swept away by Bella’s world view as she manoeuvres her way around the challenges of the wild, and the people she encounters. The dog playing the adult version of Bella is a scene-stealer who will charm her way into every canine lover’s heart. The human actors are less impressive. The main character Lucas played by Jonah Hauer-King has the chocolate boy look intact but brings little else of note. The bond between Bella and him is solidified primarily by the canine, and it’s often hard to grasp Lucas’ connection to his beloved pet. While this can be overlooked, it dampens the emotional impact at times. In fact, his girlfriend Olivia comes across far more invested in Bella with Alexandra Shipp’s performance. Meanwhile, watch out for Wes Studi and Edward James Olmos in small but impactful roles.</p><p>The plot is predictable – it’s spelt out in the title, but the screenplay throws some curveballs along the way to ensure all the clichés don’t get too overbearing.

She convinces her friends to join her in search of the big world, but instead, they come across the Institute for Perfection where dolls go through a series of tests to be paired with the right child. <br><br> Although its core idea is that we should accept one another despite our differences, ‘UglyDolls’ squanders this timeless lesson and reduces it to a film that doesn’t know how to engage with its audience. Breaking into song at every occasion it gets to maximise the talents of its voice cast is the logical approach, but the tracks are neither well written nor composed to make them memorable. They end up becoming a drag, and it doesn’t help that the rest of the plot isn’t exactly innovative either. Add voice acting that’s uninspired with almost every actor seemingly phoning in their lines. In this sea of weak performances, Janelle Monae makes a genuine attempt to make her character Mandy stand out, but her role is relatively small to make a significant difference. <br><br> To make matters worse, the animation and character design are both less than stellar. Although the ‘ugly dolls’ are made to look endearing enough, the ‘perfect’ dolls come across as poorly rendered video game ripoffs. The environment designs aren’t memorable despite the limited areas the film is set in. The biggest blunder is the film’s screenplay that goes all over the place as it’s unable to keep its target audience in focus – it veers between catering to kids and then to adolescents, with its group dynamics, and the constant peer pressure to look a certain way. Sadly, this ends up being – and there’s no joy in making this pun – an ugly mess.<br><br><br><br>","2.0","Negativo"

When these two meet in a film, the audience knows what to expect. Ideally, that would take away the surprise element, but it’s the writing of these characters that keep you invested.<br><br> Tiffin is in the best form portraying the unpredictability of Hardin in measured tones. It’s easy to root for him even when he’s not doing the right thing. He also gets some really cool lines that add to the curiosity around his character. Josephine Langford successfully brings the vulnerability of Tessa to fore. Her performance is honest and understated that portrays her hunger for new experiences. Selma Blair as Tessa’s mother performs well in her limited screen time. But the rest of the cast has too many clichés. College teens sporting tattoos and nose piercings, a spiteful and vamp-ish fellow student with pigtails and a constant smirk, girl’s supportive friend in college, who is dark skinned. Wonder why? There are also American stereotypes like the dysfunctional families, daddy issues and single parents.<br><br> But none of that hampers the film’s strong emotional texture. Writers Susan McMartin and Tamara Chestna weave in the intense romance between Tessa and Hardin in a conventional yet mystical way that builds interest.<br><br> There are not many twists and the narrative is simple. However, it hoodwinks you into feeling that something really unusual will happen - whether or not it does, is for you to find out. Sex scenes are aplenty but none of them over-the-top. They are aesthetically executed and remain complimentary to the storytelling. Director Jenny Gage handles those scenes with finesse, never letting her young, good looking actors lose their next-door image. This helps the audience stay connected with the characters and feel for them. The pace is slow, but consistent with moments that will stay with you. Soundtrack packs quite a punch into this intense college romance.<br><br> ‘After’ is as formulaic as it is ambitious for young lovers who seek exciting first experiences.

Directors Anthony and Joe Russo ensure that the humongous build-up and the avalanche of expectations do not get the better of them. They deliver a largely wholesome product that is full of moments laced with action, emotion, comedy and drama. Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely take you along, even if you haven’t been following the franchise. They do an incredible job with the screenplay to balance emotions with visual spectacle. So if you’re not a fan yet, chances are, you might become one after watching this instalment.<br><br> While the screen time for each character is not equal, their significance in the story is. And there are enough surprises in store, as far as their fates are concerned. ‘Endgame’ delivers quite well on the emotional quotient, bringing out superpowers and vulnerabilities of its cinematic demigods through their measured performances. From an upright Captain America (Chris Evans) to a stoic Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and from a straight-faced Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) delivering the punches to the reassuring presence of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), ‘Endgame’ has it all and a lot more. Thanks to the conviction in performances, you also might just find yourself rooting for the bad guy, Thanos (Josh Brolin) at some point. However, it’s the comic collective of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Ant Man (Paul Rudd) that ensures there are enough lighter moments in this otherwise heartfelt finale.<br><br> The action becomes progressively intense, but never overbearing. In fact, it remains relevant and true to the narrative, such that it weaves in enough opportunities for major plot twists that even the diehard fans may not see coming. The extensive CGI work adds to the visual appeal, even in 2D.<br><br> For the non-fans, the film’s explanatory tone might come across as a speed breaker at times, but for the fans, the same invokes hope and excitement, leading to constant gasps and howls.<br><br> Overall, 'Avengers: Endgame' is a befitting tribute to the Cinematic Universe that has spawned larger-than-life superheroes and super fans.

He’s tasked with a lot of the spell casting and chanting; not only does he do that with conviction, but he also brings some much-needed humour into the script, and he has his moments. Patricia Velasquez as Patricia Alvarez has a significant role to play, and she’s also adept at playing a mentally disturbed woman. The evil spirit itself - La Llorona, the weeping woman, played by Marisol Ramirez has a spooky appearance and intimidating presence when she’s on screen.<br> <br> But that effect wears off pretty quickly because this is a horror film, and it makes sure to keep reminding you with all its screeching and creaking sound design, often resorting to the predictable jump scare treatment. What makes it even more frustrating is that the exposition is on the nose, because it must explain the backstory of the Weeping Woman. This is done in such an obvious way that makes the film drag between the scary scenes. With that, all the potential from this film goes flying out of the window, and you’re left with yet another horror film. The actors try to work their best with the shoddy material, but it’s not quite enough. Those who get scared easily will get spooked anyway; those who want more from their horror films will be left craving for that.<br><br><br><br><br>","3.0","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Hellboy Story:</strong> When an ancient sorceress wants to take down the world, our only hope is a warrior demon from the depths of hell itself.<br><strong>Hellboy Review: </strong>Hellboy (David Harbour) is raised by his adoptive father Professor Broom (Ian McShane) to work alongside humans in the Bureau for Paranormal Research (BRPD) – an organisation that protects people from otherworldly forces who threaten the planet. Hellboy’s supernatural abilities are put to the test when the Blood Queen (Milla Jovovich) is raised from the undead, in a bid to take revenge on humans who tried to destroy her ages ago. Neil Marshall’s reboot of Guillermo Del Toro’s two films based on this comic-book universe aims to set itself apart with a distinctly gory, and expletive-laden tone. Marshall understands how to stage large scale action set pieces, and there are a couple of sequences that are disturbing, yet hilarious. But there’s little else of note. <br><br> Milla Jovovich as the villain is bad, and not in a cheesy yet enjoyable manner. She struggles to convey the required sense of menace; her dialogue delivery fluctuates between wooden and comical. It also doesn’t help that the Blood Queen is a weak antagonist who holds a lot of promise but doesn’t quite bring it eventually. Meanwhile, David Harbour is perfectly cast as the lead character. Hellboy is mighty while being snappy with oodles of wit, and Harbour nails down his devilishly fun persona. Ian McShane also attempts to add some pathos to the distorted father-son relationship Professor Broom shares with Hellboy.<br><br> Sadly, as soon as you begin to appreciate these sub-plots, the next action sequence is thrown at us. The tonality is wildly uneven which isn’t helped as outrageous characters enter the narrative with little context, and often exit quickly as well. If Marshall’s mere intent was to shock you with excessive gore and expletives, then he manages to do that. It isn’t quite enough, especially if you leave the theatre confused about what just happened, due to a ludicrous plot. Despite McShane and Harbour’s best efforts, this exhaustive ‘end-of-the-world’ story is unable to raise as much hell as it should.<br>","2.5","Negativo"

Ellie wanders around the property when she comes across a burial ground that reads ‘Pet Sematary’. After Rachel finds Ellie, their neighbour Jud Crandall (John Lithgow) warns them not to stray too far from home as the woods aren’t safe. The Creed family soon discovers why this warning is not to be taken lightly. Those familiar with the 1989 version will be caught unaware by the changes made for this remake, although it would be best advised to avoid all the official trailers to maintain an element of surprise. <br><br> In this new adaptation of Stephen King’s novel, directors Kevin Kölsch & Dennis Widmeyer spin a fresh perspective, which has the potential to be far more impactful. After all, this harrowing tale is about the grieving process and how different people deal with the death of their loved ones. Sadly, this narrative is not explored to its full potential, as the directors often choose to focus on audio-visual elements for the sake of scares instead. This nullifies strong performances by the consistently brilliant John Lithgow as Jud, and Jeté Laurence’s standout turn as Ellie. Both Jason Clarke and Amy Seimetz are effective playing parents grasping at straws to keep their family intact. There’s a backstory setting up an intriguing angle that promises to work well with the overall theme, but is squandered as not enough time is spent on character development. <br><br> The twists wear thin as the film rushes to the finish line, by not allowing the weight of harrowing events to land as hard as they should, despite the tragedies hitting hard. In fact, this is a film that could afford a few more scenes for the terror to dig deeper within your psyche as it draws up some of your own demons. While the audience is spooked at regular intervals thanks to the compelling atmosphere and unsettling sound design, the cumulative effect starts to wear off eventually. Yet, the very nature of this story is disturbing enough to compel you to see it through, helped by its taut run-time, and one terrifying cat!<br><br><br>","3.0","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>STORY: </strong>Based on the 2012 documentary with the same name, ‘Fighting with my Family’ is the true story of the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) star Saraya Knight. The film charts her journey from a small town in the UK to becoming a WWE celebrity, where she realises her true potential.<br><br> <strong>REVIEW: </strong>“Wrestling is like soap opera in Spandex.” This and many such quirky lines are a part of this film’s narrative based on a die-hard wrestler family from Norwich, England. The film opens and ends with wrestling, but you don’t have to be a fan to enjoy it. That’s because director Stephen Merchant never lets the sport take over the film’s emotional fabric. <br><br> Bound by strong performances, ‘Fighting with my Family’ is full of endearing moments between a family that eats together, fights together and lives together. Leading the pack is the film’s protagonist Florence Pugh, who plays the feisty Paige. Whether it’s the hardcore wrestling scenes or the emotional exchanges with her sibling, Pugh doesn’t miss a beat. She looks strong and vulnerable at the same time. Ditto for Jack Lowden, who lives the character of Zak with all honesty, reflecting his internal conflict and pain. But it is Vince Vaughn’s understated portrayal of coach Hutch Morgan that shines the brightest. Even the special appearance by ‘The Rock’, is well utilized with a quite an impactful entry scene. He gets some cool lines that enhance his larger than life screen presence. Rest of the cast performs well.<br><br> While there are clichés like the training montages, the sibling conflicts that get resolved conveniently and the underdog angle, there are also nuanced differentiators. For example, the former models competing with Paige are not stereotyped as dumb blondes. In fact, their roles are sensitively written and the confrontation scenes between the girls are amusing, inside and outside the wrestling ring. Film’s pace gets a bit sluggish in parts, but the oddball family dynamics come to the rescue. There is a constant flow of organic humour, seamlessly written into the characters.<br><br> For a film on wrestlers, there aren’t too many actual fight scenes, but as an entertainer, it delivers a knockout punch and wrestles its way to your heart.<br>","4.0","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Shazam! Story: </strong>Street-smart Billy Batson (Asher Angel) runs away from one foster home to the next, in search of his birth mother. Along the way, he encounters a mysterious wizard (Djimon Hounsou) who gives him the ability to transform into an adult with superpowers (Zachary Levi) by merely saying the word ‘Shazam’.<br><strong><br>Shazam! Review: </strong>From its opening frames, ‘Shazam!’ sets out to address the origin tale pitfalls inherent to the superhero genre. It quickly establishes a comical, yet sensitive tonality which allows the audience to get on-board with an otherwise outlandish premise. Director David F. Sandberg captures the imagination, enthusiasm, and pure glee of a little kid playing with his/ her toys. He maintains an irreverent and exuberant approach throughout. But that sentiment wouldn’t translate if it wasn’t conveyed so well by the cast. Under Sandberg’s direction, they give their characters the right amount of self-awareness without veering too far into camp.<br><br>This is especially applicable to Zachary Levi, whose playfulness as the title character never gets old. He’s able to portray a sincere, yet immature adolescent trying to take on the big, bad world and yet, doesn’t know his own limits as a superhero. It also becomes obvious that Billy Batson (Asher Angel) isn’t familiar with how a powered individual works, and that allows superhero nerd Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer) to show him the ropes. Some of the best scenes include Shazam discovering his abilities with Freddy, and they’re a joy to behold. Family is the narrative thread that binds the film. Even the villain Dr Thaddeus Sivana (Mark Strong) is forged by how his father and brother treat him as a young boy. That, along with Billy’s search for his birth mother, and his inability to find a home he can fit into, is where the plot finds its footing.<br><br>Despite this, the screenplay never falls prey to melodrama, and the usual genre tropes are acknowledged, then promptly downplayed. The stakes are relatively lower than what we’re used to, and yet crucial enough within this film. Even the action set-pieces don’t focus on fight choreography. Instead, those moments are used to further character development. It’s a risky move that does falter slightly towards the finish line, but that’s excused because everything else leading up to it is so much fun. Bolstered by Zachary Levi’s undeniable charm, ‘Shazam!’ embodies the child-like wonder associated with superhero/ comic movies. In a welcome change of pace, it is undoubtedly the lightest and most entertaining entry into the DC roster.<br><br>","4.0","Positivo"

Stella tries to battle her illness using social media to educate people on how it affects patients. She’s also extremely mindful about her medical regimen, by keeping track and organizing her pills using an app that she made. On the other hand, Will throws caution to the wind as he believes they are living on borrowed time, and prefers to make the most of their short lives. CF patients need to be kept 6 feet apart as they suffer the risk of contracting infections. This becomes a big hindrance when Stella and Will fall in love with each other. <br><br> If the very notion of this plot makes you go weak in your knees, then this film is definitely for you. Falling firmly within the ‘tragic romance’ genre, ‘Five Feet Apart’ follows the typical clichés one would expect from this by-the-numbers setup. Chances are that tears will also be shed along the way. But it has a few surprises as well. For one, Haley Lu Richardson displays an impressive range and depth in her performance. This allows us to become engrossed with Stella Grant’s coping mechanisms while celebrating her small victories. Stella’s arc anchors the narrative down, especially when the screenplay feels stretched out. As soon as Stella meets Will, you know they’re going to fall for each other, but the plot takes its time to get there. Cole Sprouse as Will is also charming and effective. But it doesn’t help that he’s tasked with clunky dialogue particularly in a pivotal scene during the climax that makes him comes across quite cheesy. <br><br> The film seems to be a genuine attempt to illustrate how CF patients deal with relationships along with their multiple restrictions. Stella’s friendship with Poe (Moises Arias) is often far more intriguing as it is devoid of romantic chemistry. Nurse Barb (Kimberly Hebert Gregory) and her concern for these patients also demonstrate some of the challenges faced by caretakers, and the effect it has on them. Despite a run-time that director Justin Baldoni could have easily trimmed down to a crisper version, ‘Five Feet Apart’ manages to be engaging due to its performances, and is more than likely to pull on heartstrings in some unexpected places. <br><br>","3.5","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story</strong><strong>: </strong>Inspired from the 1941 classic Walt Disney animation film with the same name, 'Dumbo' is about an endearing baby elephant, who literally finds wings to fly, when he flaps his unusually large ears. The film charts Dumbo’s journey in the quest to find his mother, as he becomes the star attraction of a struggling circus.<br><br><strong>Review</strong><strong>: </strong>“Wonder elephant soars to fame,” reads the headline of a newspaper that publishes the story of a flying elephant gliding across the circus tent. That is one of the most exhilarating visuals, which is bound to stay with you much after the film is over. Director Tim Burton’s mastery in creating visual fantasies is once again at display in this simplistic film about emotions that are universal. Set in 1919, every frame of the film captures the essence of what it tries to convey. Burton and his screenplay writer Ehren Kruger stick to the staple Disney tricks in telling a simple yet effective tale that has already been told before. Thankfully, the director manages to get the right amount of restrain from most of his actors. <br><br>As a former circus star and a World War I veteran, Colin Farrell is convincing as Holt Farrier. He brings in the vulnerability of a single parent and a circus star, who is reduced to training the elephants after losing an arm in the war. Veteran actor Danny DeVito (Max Medici) goes a little over-the-top at times, but as the boisterous ringmaster and an owner of a struggling circus, he is allowed to do so. Eva Green sets many a hearts racing with her beauty and grace as the French trapeze artist Colette Marchant. Burton also manages to establish the connection between Dumbo and the two children, who mirror the loss of their own mother, when Dumbo is separated from his. Micheal Keaton in his caricature bad guy act looks menacing and funny, both at the same time..<br><br>But the film’s A game clearly lies in its protagonist. The novelty of Dumbo’s flying act doesn’t wear off even when the act itself becomes repetitive. Every time the pachyderm flies, it takes you along with it. The scenes involving the mother elephant are emotionally stirring and will strike a chord with the audience. Film’s visual scale towers above many of its obvious flaws, but doesn’t quite lift it above Burton’s legacy of creating magical realism in the past. While there are problems such as predictability, caricature characters and a sluggish pace, 'Dumbo' has its moments. Overall, it’s a harmless family entertainer for children of all ages.<br>","3.5","Positivo"

The mob who killed Staines accused him of converting the tribals to Christianity by inducement, fraudulent means.<span class='Apple-converted-space'> </span></p><p><b>Review</b>: Poverty sees no religion and hunger has its own language. Faith is a choice but if it’s manipulated by humanitarian means, and helps someone survive in the bargain, can you overlook the intent behind the kind deeds? Should an agenda really matter if it’s benefiting the poor and those ostracised by the society? Also, shouldn’t those who wish to help, look beyond religion? All these questions pop into your head as you watch the recreation of a tense and tragic real life incident play out on screen.<span class='Apple-converted-space'> </span></p><p>A deeply provocative issue of ‘religious conversion’ and a brutal and barbaric hate crime that followed, forms the story of this social drama.

Stephen Baldwin, whose pout is reminiscent of his brother Alec Baldwin’s , when he mimics Donald Trump on SNL, plays Staines with just the right amount of empathy and calm. Sharman does a decent job as well but his character is poorly written.</p><p>Manav seems way too ignorant, childish, naive and prejudiced to be a journalist. As a reporter, he is assigned the job of gathering evidence that proves Staines is guilty of breaking laws and indulging in forced conversion. His investigative approach towards a sensitive story that expects him to go undercover sees him announcing to the world that he is a journalist (dumbest way to get killed). He even threatens a bus conductor when the latter asks him to pay for his bus ticket. “I am a journalist. I will write against this bus of yours.” (Okay then!)<span class='Apple-converted-space'> </span></p><p>The narrative is lop-sided and portrays anyone who analyses and studies the motives of missionaries as ‘bad people’. A journalist’s job is to investigate. He should be doing that without any guilt or preconceived notions. The writing lacks balance and maturity. Here, Manav is merely made to look like a villain to be able to look transformed eventually. His psychological conversion, (from accuser to believer) lacks depth and a close observation.</p><p>Like the subject it tackles, Aneesh Daniel’s execution and Andrew Matthew’s writing seems a tad agenda driven.

Now, with her husband Gabriel Wilson (Winston Duke) and two children, the lookalikes of the Wilsons are out to get them. But as the family makes desperate attempts to escape, they discover a much larger and sinister plot at play.<br><br><strong>Review:</strong> ‘Us’ begins in the modest 1986 setting when amusement parks on American beaches came with all sorts of funny and mysterious games. In them, was always a dingy fun house with a maze of mirrors that can leave you more terrified than amused. Writer-Director Jordan Peele sets the stage for a mystery thriller right from the start, taking us into his make-believe world of unnerving possibilities. Along the way he also drops subtle hints about the film’s layered narrative that points towards many uncomfortable truths about the world we live in. Pay attention to them.<br><br>Peele’s storytelling is masterfully unhinged in its execution to accommodate his unique vision.<br><br>The central theme of the film is gradually unraveled in a disturbing narrative that requires constant suspension of disbelief.<br><br>Film’s writing is peppered with organic humour that often serves as a natural respite from high tension. The background score adds to the overall impact. While there are a few jumpscares for those looking for regular horror gimmicks, a large part of spookiness comes from its extended metaphor.<br><br>However, what works without any ambiguity is the rock solid performance by the Academy Award winner Lupita Nyong’o. She single handedly conveys bulk of the emotions that range from instilling the fear to expressing it. Dressed in the red jumpsuit as the menacing doppleganger from the group called ‘The Tethered’ she is delectably frightening. Winston Duke’s character is endearing as he tries to be a hero for his family. He does well within the limitation of his relatively underwritten role.<br><br>There are a few nagging questions that remain unexplained despite many cryptic references, which is bound to leave you frustrated, especially, if you miss some of the clues thrown in earlier. But Peele’s conviction comes together in the climax, as he makes a final revelation that could lead to a catastrophic new world order.<br><br>‘Us’ is as refreshing as it is perplexing. As the director takes you into the eerie world of his protagonist, he attempts to marry deep rooted sociopolitical issues with cinematic horrors, and eventually leaves you with some food for thought.

This leads to overpopulation in Berk, so all its inhabitants need to find a bigger and safer place to live. Meanwhile, Toothless is instantly enamoured by the discovery of a female Light Fury which could complicate Hiccup's search for the mythical 'Hidden World'.<br><br> With two strong entries prior to it, ‘The Hidden World’ could have easily suffered from the ‘trilogy curse’ by botching up its finale. Fortunately, that’s not the case. From the first few frames, it becomes evident that DreamWorks Animation has pushed the envelope with graphics that are astounding. The beautifully rendered vistas and fluid close-quarter action work seamlessly with each other, making the film an immensely gratifying experience in 3D. But the visuals wouldn’t be complete without a compelling storyline. Writer-director Dean DeBlois displays his in-depth understanding of this world and its characters in his third outing at the helm. He takes the tale of Hiccup, Toothless, and their friends to its natural progression, while still managing to keep the storyline fresh, if not entirely unpredictable. <br><br> It also helps that the voice cast is now extremely comfortable with their characters. This shows in some of the filler humour that could be awkward in other circumstances, especially with Valka (Cate Blanchett), but ends up being amusing enough. America Ferrera as Astrid, Jonah Hill as Snoutlout, Kristen Wiig as Ruffnut, and Craig Fergusson as Gobber - all get their moments to shine, though it’s only natural that Jay Baruchel stands out as Hiccup. The weakest character comes in the form of the villain Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham), who is yet another dragon trapper with a bone to pick. Nevertheless, the character arcs of Hiccup, and his search for the Hidden World combined with Toothless, who comes into his own as the alpha dragon, drive a strong emotional connect that pays off in the end. This saga began with their relationship, so it’s only fitting that it should conclude with them. 'How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World' is a visually stunning and emotionally satisfying conclusion to a surprisingly well-rounded 'vikings & dragons' trilogy that will appeal to various age groups for different reasons.<br><br><br>","4.0","Positivo"

Despite other strong female superheroes who have arguably earned their standalone film (Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Valkyrie), the MCU's focus on the build-up to 'Avengers: Endgame' has reached a fever pitch. So, it only makes sense to introduce Carol Danvers (Brie Larson), or Captain Marvel as a vital piece in the puzzle. When we first meet Danvers, she is a powerful soldier of an alien race known as the Kree. Even though she feels a strong connection to Earth, she is unaware of her identity. During an intergalactic battle, she crashes on Earth, known as C-53, where she encounters Agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson).

She isn’t as brooding as the trailers make her out to be; in fact, Danvers shares some of the lighter moments with a pre-eye-patch Nick Fury. Samuel L. Jackson seems to enjoy playing a relatively naïve version of the otherwise surly Fury who quickly learns that everything is not as it seems. Jude Law's addition to the MCU isn't exactly memorable, but Ben Mendelsohn particularly stands out. The 90’s tonality, complete with a grunge-era soundtrack is a good look for the MCU, and it lends ample opportunities for humour. Although the script aims at big laughs, it doesn’t always succeed. In fact, real guffaws come from unexpected places. Hint: cat-lovers will be thoroughly delighted with Goose, who arguably turns out to be a real scene-stealer.<br><br>There are a few narrative surprises in the script, despite the superhero moments being well intact.

There are several instances as the camera focuses on her visage, especially when Joan Castleman contemplates the decisions she made, and you can practically see the complex series of thoughts running in her head. Little wonder that Close has been nominated, and won numerous awards for this incredible performance. Christian Slater is surprisingly sneaky as Nathanial Bone, who is a catalyst to the events that unfold.

The first few minutes play out like a predictable thriller, featuring a wronged father and his pursuit for vigilante justice.

Yet, director Hans Petter Noland, who also made the Norwegian film In Order Of Disappearance that inspired Cold Pursuit, and writer Frank Baldwin create a refreshing narrative full of memorable moments. The movie seems bizarrely funny and the snow-heavy setting creates the right atmosphere for the dry and cold-cut humour.<br><br><br>The story begins with tragedy and the first few minutes seem dead serious, right up to the point where Coxman confronts his first victim, the gangster named Speedo. But, as the revenge-seeking father moves up the ranks of the mafia chain, the characters become quirky and the situations get thoroughly entertaining. The introduction of characters like Viking (Tom Bateman), the main antagonist and his team of crazy henchmen like Mustang, Dexter and more, alleviates the narrative. There’s also a track of warring mafia gangs as Viking wages a war against the native Indians led by White Bull (Tom Jackson). Cold Pursuit may not be too creative with the kill sequences, but it does get interesting with the wry sense of humour.<br><br><br>Neeson does what he does best.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part Story: </strong>The citizens of Bricksburg face a new threat when invaders from outer space destroy everything in their town quicker than they can rebuild it.<br><br> <strong>The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part Review</strong>: Years have passed since Emmet (Chris Pratt) and his friends, Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), Batman (Will Arnett), Unikitty (Alison Brie), Metalbeard (Nick Offerman), and Benny (Charlie Day) saved the town of Bricksburg. Since then, mysterious beings from another universe have attacked the city and reduced it to ruins. If that wasn’t bad enough, Emmet’s friends are abducted by alien invaders, and he needs to find ways to defeat these new threats, restore peace and harmony to Bricksburg, and generally ensure that ‘everything is awesome’ once again.<br><br> Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who wrote and directed the first LEGO Movie, are back in their writing roles in this sequel. While they’ve handed over directorial duties to Mike Mitchell this time around, they are well aware of what worked for its prequel. ‘The LEGO Movie’ was funny, creative and heart-warming; this second part is no different. It’s a much bigger challenge to pen a compelling story especially since the reveal was made at the end of the previous film. Yet, their new premise builds on that while being fresh and heartfelt all at once. They are far more confident in this universe’s tonality, even crossing over to the real world and back to great effect while appealing to different age-groups.<br><br> The voice cast also quickly finds their groove again. Chris Pratt leads the charming charge by working on not one but two characters. Will Arnett and Elizabeth Banks get ample moments to take centre stage, and deliver consistently. New additions Tiffany Haddish as Queen Watevra Wa-Nabi, and Stephanie Beatriz as General Mayhem fit right into the mix. The inclusion of the new characters and the different perspectives they bring are indicators that this universe can keep throwing surprises while staying true to its quirky tone and kaleidoscopic visuals. Granted, it’s hard to shake off the feeling that the freshness of the original can never be matched, and even though the plot is seemingly straightforward – Emmett must save this world once more – ‘The LEGO Movie 2’ manages to be ‘awesome’ by turning some genre expectations into new opportunities. The makers continue to retain this world’s unique sense of self-aware humour and graphic style in this sequel, proving that the franchise is here to stay.<br>","4.0","Positivo"

When he restores her, it becomes quickly evident that she’s no ordinary machine. Alita, as he names her, has an innate child-like curiosity. She quickly learns to adapt to the harsh world around her. Along the way she also discovers her history and the real power she wields as she finds her place in a future that makes a clear distinction between the haves & have-nots.<br><br> To say that producer James Cameron is instrumental in creating a compelling post-apocalyptic future should come as no surprise from the man who knows a thing or two about killer robots. But Cameron and director Robert Rodriguez are also known to pay a lot of attention to a film’s plot; both proving their respective abilities to flesh out intriguing characters and using emotionally driven story-telling to power action sequences. Beyond the technical superiority expected from a film that has Cameron attached to it, the emotional heft of ‘Alita: Battle Angel' comes from a connection to the characters. A lot has been said about the lead’s anime-inspired eyes. While they might be an acquired taste, there are many compelling reasons to get lost in them. Rodriguez ensures that Alita is the embodiment of the adage – the eyes are the windows to the soul. Alita is an old soul, and she draws you into her self-discovery. Rosa Salazar brings oodles of charm and conviction to make Alita a fully-realised CGI persona. Christoph Waltz is perfectly cast as her father-figure, and their relationship anchors the plot as the set-pieces unfold around them. The other cyborg figures played by Ed Skrein, Eiza Gonzalez and Jackie Earle Haley add to the deadly mix to make for thrilling fight scenes. However, the considerable talents of Mahershala Ali & Jennifer Connelly are largely wasted. <br><br>The biggest problem with ‘Alita: Battle Angel’ is that it resorts to 'origin' tropes. Although it soars leaps and bounds in the technical department, it's hard to shake off the feeling that we're all too familiar with this story. There’s also a completely unnecessary romantic angle that the film could have done without. While Rodriguez and Cameron push the boundaries of computer wizardry, they choose to follow the storytelling textbook, so whether they succeed in breaking the curse of the live-action anime adaptation is up for debate. That aside, ‘Alita: Battle Angel’ is another testament to the power of big-screen IMAX 3D extravaganzas even though there are no great surprises in its ‘last-of-her-kind’ narrative.<br>","3.5","Positivo"

Here winning or losing is a matter of life and death and they need to work together to get out alive.<br><br><strong>Escape Room Review:</strong> The escape room concept is relatively well known - a group of people are trapped in a room, and the only way out is to solve complex riddles and clues. This sub-genre has been seen before in the ‘Saw’ series, and the concept goes back even further to 1997 with the Canadian film ‘Cube’. In ‘Escape Room’, we’re introduced to a couple of the characters and see how they end up in this life-or-death situation. Along the way, we also discover how the other players fit into the deadly game. Although some of them might get on your nerves for different reasons, it’s the way they’ve been written, with no fault of the actors, per se. <br><br> Taylor Russell plays Zoey Davis, a brilliant college student who is an introvert. Jay Ellis plays Jason Walker, a successful, and cocky chap who thinks he’s better than everyone else. Deborah Ann Woll plays Amanda Harper, probably the most layered character of them all. She has a huge role to play in one of the rooms which happens to be the most nail-biting. The momentum ramps up until this room, approximately midway through the film, but takes a sharp downturn from this point on. It then becomes apparent that the intriguing reason why these strangers are forced to work together hadn’t been thought through. <br><br> Director Adam Robitel tries to hard sell the tried and tested concept with a brand-new packaging, which soon wears thin. Barring a couple of surprises, whatever investment is made into the proceedings stunningly fails towards the last lap and dramatically crashes in the climax. The scriptwriters appear to be stuck in an escape room of their own making, as they write themselves into a corner with no way out. Instead, they resort to an inane and bizarre ending. Sure, there will be moviegoers who’ll enjoy the thrills of ‘Escape Room’ for the most part. But it’ll be hard for anyone to escape all the sub-genre tropes that eventually drag the film down.<br><br><br>","3.0","Positivo"

Naturally, this doesn’t go down well with her cousin, the Queen of England, Elizabeth I (Margot Robbie). Queen Elizabeth is Protestant, unmarried and childless, while Queen Mary is Catholic. Naturally, Mary is immediately perceived as a threat to Elizabeth’s place on the throne. This leads to a series of dangerous scheming in both courts as the two strong-willed women battle their way through manipulative advisers as they take each other on.<br><br> Saoirse Ronan is an immediate standout; the young actress gives a passionate performance as the Queen of Scotland with a fierce on-screen presence that demands your attention. Margot Robbie is no less impactful, as the somewhat erratic and unpredictable Queen Elizabeth. She disappears under layers of makeup, which is symbolic in how it’s hard to tell Elizabeth’s true intentions. She oscillates between vulnerable and steadfast, although one wonders if that is by design or due to the lack of clarity in how her character is defined. The supporting cast is pretty solid, with Guy Pearce and David Tennant on Elizabeth’s side of the border, respectively playing William Cecil and John Knox with convincingly sinister undertones. In Mary’s court, Lord Darnley played by Jack Lowden and Ismael Cruz Cordova’s David Rizzio are the most memorable characters. Their interplay drives a majority of the plot which leads to the film’s pivotal point. <br><br> Up until that point though, the tonality runs between being mildly interesting to downright drab, as director Josie Rourke focuses on putting all the pieces in motion for the eventual showdown between Mary and Elizabeth. While historically debatable – the two allegedly never met – seeing Margot Robbie and Saoirse Ronan confront each other is magnetic. Equally mesmerising is the attention given to the costume and set design, to the point of being distracting in the best way possible. Likewise, John Mathieson’s cinematography elegantly captures Scotland’s stunning vistas. In the end, the film’s intended impact is severely hampered by clunky pacing and a convoluted plot that fails to engage. ‘Mary Queen of the Scots’ has a timely premise with a lot to say about toxic masculinity and women empowerment but never gets around to it, despite its brief sparks of brilliance that quickly die out before catching fire.<br><br>","3.0","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'><b>One Less God Story:</b> Guests at Mumbai's Taj hotel try to survive an attack by terrorists in 2008. <br><br><b>One Less God Review:</b> ‘One Less God’ revisits the horrific attacks on the iconic Taj Hotel through two lenses – one from the terrorists’ perspective, and the other from the guests trapped by them. While based on true events, both these perspectives are fictionalised for the film. The guests come from different nationalities and backgrounds. Sean (Joseph Mahler Taylor) is an Irishman and is the closest to a ‘main’ character. Selim (Igor Kreyman) and Eda (Reilly O’Byrne-Inglis) are Turkish siblings who continuously squabble with each other. Fate brings them together with an Australian Jewish couple (Nathan Kaye and Nicole Fantl), along with a few other unfortunate souls. Meanwhile, an elderly grandfather (Sukhraj Deepak) and his grand-daughter Atiya (Mihika Rao) are trapped in another room. <br><br>It is impossible to shake off the horrific images emerging from the 2008 attacks on the Taj. Director Lliam Worthington blends real footage captured outside Mumbai’s historic landmark, along with harrowing scenes from within. Since the guests are all fictional, Worthington takes time to set up their backstories. While some of those eventually contribute to the narrative, a few don’t, and they merely add to the film’s run-time. In fact, one of the characters who doesn’t have any setup delivers some of the film’s most touching moments. Speaking of which, the arc between Atiya and Gradda is bound to pull on heartstrings, with the two of them sharing a genuinely endearing relationship. <br><br>The performances from the relatively unknown, yet adept cast add to the tension – there’s no clear-cut protagonist, so it’s impossible to predict who will survive the ordeal. The cinematography is also worth mentioning, with some well-planned and executed shots that immerse you into the brutality of the attacks. But then some sequences tend to go on longer than required, which dilutes that impact. This is particularly evident when the focus shifts to the two terrorists and their anonymous, faceless handler. As a debut film director, Lliam Worthington dons many hats behind the camera – producing, editing, and conceptually writing the story as well. For this endeavour alone, his efforts are commendable although he tends to drop one component while juggling others. A key element is an underlying message narrated at the beginning and end of the film, which runs the risk of being slightly on-the-nose. ‘One Less God’ revisits Mumbai's 26/11 through this fictional story that falters in some areas, but works well enough as a whole.<br>","3.5","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Scientist William Foster (Keanu Reeves) works in a specialised lab, researching on transferring the consciousness of dead people into a synthetic body. After a grave personal tragedy, he decides to use his experimental technology to create clones and figure out a way to perfect the process.<br><br><br><strong>Review: </strong>Films from the sci-fi genre usually have to be a bit far-fetched. The concept of such films needs to be out-of-the-box and engaging to the extent that it allows the viewer to stretch the limits of their imagination. Keanu Reeves has made a career working in such movies – Johnny Mnemonic, The Matrix series and The Day The Earth Stood Still, so he’s right at home in the world of Replicas, where the human brain of a deceased person is replicated onto a cyber drive and then transferred onto a robot with a synthetic brain. <br><br><br>Director Jeffrey Nachmanoff’s film takes a few liberties with reality to present its high-concept premise. Reeves’ Foster manages to clone actual humans, even when his best friend and expert Ed (Thomas Middleditch) tells him that they’ve never tried the technology on humans before. Even as it stretches the limitations of actual science, the film makes abundant rookie mistakes. Foster actually runs a search string on a computer to instantly map all memories on a human brain related to one person. It just feels a little too convenient. What Replicas does really well, especially in its initial stages is that it plays out like a psychological thriller. It creates a genuinely interesting air around the people who get cloned and the fact that they feel like empty shells and not a complete person. But, this cerebral pursuit soon gives way to action-thriller clichés like car chases, double crosses and dodgy CGI sequences. The film goes from marginally smart sci-fi to frustrating b-movie thrills in a matter of seconds. <br><br><br>Reeves plays his conflicted and dazed character with the usual straight face. No other actor plays the detached hero with steely resolve better than him, but even with his poker face charisma, the sci-fi star can’t pull off the umpteen hair-brained ideas in the final act of the film. John Ortiz’s Jones, the proverbial bad guy is the worst part of the movie. His stereotypical evil boss act ruins the story completely.<br><br>Replicas is the sort of film that Hollywood usually redirects to direct-to-home video or online releases. It’s a hotchpotch of cool sci-fi ideas, executed with novice filmmaking skills and an underwhelming budget. This one’s best described as a cheap knockoff.<br>","2.5","Negativo"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Glass, M Night Shyamalan’s third instalment in his Eastrail 177 trilogy, a sequel to Unbreakable (2000) and Split (2016), is a riveting psychological thriller that works as an intriguing spin-off to Hollywood’s conventional superhero movies. <br><br><strong>Review: </strong>Not all superheroes wear capes and not all want to save the world. Some — Samuel L. Jackson as Mr Glass, hope to believe in themselves even as the world perceives them as freaks, while the others — James McAvoy as ‘the beast’ and 23 other personalities, may just want to protect themselves. <br><br>Security guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) uses his supernatural abilities to track Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), a man with an extreme case of Dissociative Identity Disorder. He has 24 separate personalities residing in his mind. However, things spiral out of control and the two land up in a psychiatric research center, where they encounter Mr Glass. <br><br>Revolving around its three anti-heroes (Glass, the beast and Bruce Willis as the ‘unbreakable’ David Dunn), M Night Shyamalan’s cleverly crafted thriller shatters the glass ceiling in its respective genre. As a matter of fact, Glass isn’t a superhero movie per se. It’s an intense psychological thriller that uses the superhero elements to study the psyche of the extraordinary characters it examines. <br><br>Those well aware of Shyamalan’s penchant for tension-driven build-up leading to an unexpected twist in the climax can rejoice here as the filmmaker lives up to your expectations from him. While the climax is rather divisive and bound to evoke polarising views, it is unpredictable and retains that sense of wonder nonetheless. A constant sense of paranoia and suspense coupled by James McAvoy and Sarah Paulson’s incredible performances, make this thriller worth watching. The mysterious equation between its central characters is the heart of the story. <br><br>However, Glass has its share of hairline cracks and chips, which over the years are pretty much synonymous to Shyamalan’s movie-making style. He has this fascinating way of engaging you in his story, drawing your unflinching attention and then untimely releasing you from his spell with a thud. What begins as a superb covert character study leads to a seemingly futile emotional roller coaster. <br><br>To cut to the chase, Glass is terrific but has its share of underwhelming moments. However, if you are the type who likes the journey regardless of the destination, Glass is your film.

Now Maya must pretend to be someone she isn’t while trying to prove herself.<br><br>While the ‘fake it till you make it’ setup has been done before in Hollywood, ‘Second Act’ draws from the quote ‘the only one who can stop you is yourself’.

The rest of the cast is also well utilised with pleasing performances from pretty much the entire cast including Vanessa Hudgens, Leah Remini, Treat Williams, Milo Ventimiglia and Charlyne Yi. Although it goes through some standard beats that aren’t exactly innovative, the cast makes it reasonably entertaining till a point. But then it throws an absolutely unbelievable twist along the way; set up with typical dialogue to make it predictable. The film then takes off in a different direction, while trying to cash in on the twist.<br><br>The comedy mostly works, but there are some odd choices, one of which is around cursing that consistently fails to amuse. The screenplay switches back and forth from comedy to drama, with romance thrown in to ensure all the necessary boxes are ticked solely with the intent of making this a chick flick.

When money gets tight and an alarming sense of cleaning up his past deeds catches up with him, Stone decides to tread along the wrong path to make things right.<br><br>‘The Mule’ is about this dysfunctional family with broken ties — which stems out of the fact that the patriarch of the household has always dodged his responsibilities and has always gone about pleasing the world outside of the four walls of his home — with crime being its parallel plot. The central character in this drama evokes a sense of pity, despite exhibiting traits of an exceedingly selfish person, when he apologises to his former wife and daughter for being an absent husband and father. He loathes the fact that he has spent a significant amount of time doing things that no longer matter. But the back story seems inadequate and doesn't provide enough pathos for the viewers to invest in Eastwood’s character. Also, it doesn't quite seem convincing that a diligent DEA officer like Bates only shows up at random intervals and yet manages to catch the culprit in the end. <br><br>Clint Eastwood, both as the director and protagonist of the film, lives up to the audience’s expectations — he is funny, witty, withdrawn and an emotional wreck, all at the same time.

The alien robot is childlike in his mannerisms, and some of the best scenes involve the two getting to know each other.

Hailee Steinfeld provides the essential human factor sorely lacking in the franchise so far. She’s far from eye-candy as Charlie tries to find her own identity while dealing with grief. John Cena as Agent Burns is effectively menacing but doesn’t add much other than a standard, disruptive authoritative figure with a bone to pick.<br><br>The 'Transformers' franchise has become synonymous with Michael Bay’s trademark bombastic action mayhem which bordered on the verge of being obnoxious, and often migraine-inducing. 'Bumblebee' immediately sets itself apart from that approach, aiming towards a character-driven narrative rather than chaotic set-pieces that stumble over themselves as things go boom. This isn’t to say the action is lacking – far from it! The fight sequences are easy to follow, and the CGI is practically seamless. Despite all the major plot points being typically predictable, credit is due to Travis Knight for achieving what one deemed impossible – erasing pretty much all memory of this film's problematic predecessors.

The CGI work is top notch, especially during some of the fantastic underwater set pieces. James Wan pays a lot of attention to the stunt choreography and how the action is interpreted through slick camera work including some impressive long-take sequences. This keeps the momentum flowing, even as the run-time feels a little bloated especially when the plot runs into choppy waters in the second act. At this point, the film stumbles over itself as it takes on a tone that's too on-the-nose for its own good. There’s one romantic angle in 'Aquaman' that feels very forced, but another comes across more genuinely. The humour doesn’t always land either and is the missing ingredient in some of the sequences that lack nuance – a premise this outlandish should be able to laugh at itself a lot more. In the antagonist department, there are one too many villains, with Black Manta feeling more like a subplot than a severe threat.

What follows is a harrowing series of events as the mother and son try to deal with the aftermath of Ben's actions before he was sent to rehab. <br> <br> Anyone wondering why Lucas Hedges has been in almost every other film can see why he's soon turning into such a big deal. Directed by his father Peter Hedges, he immerses himself entirely into the emotional roller-coaster that is Ben Burns. Lucas’ sincerity makes you want to see Ben overcome all his challenges, despite being his own biggest obstacle. It’s a character study of what an addict goes through, and how his behaviour impacts those around him. This makes Julia Roberts a fitting choice to play his mother Holly, who is hopeful and loving, yet determined about her son’s well-being. Roberts gives her most robust performance in years, as a parent who wants to protect her child from the world, but mostly, from himself. She refuses to give up on him even at his deplorable worst, giving the film its most emotional moments.<br><br> The plot, however, runs the gamut from being a mother-son relationship to a thriller which tends to take the focus off the former. This isn’t detrimental to the viewing experience overall – Peter Hedges’ writing ensures that the pace is maintained throughout, while the plot continues to be gripping. But the tonal shift is jarring especially since you are most likely to be invested in the dynamics between Holly and Lucas within the first half. Thus, the climax loses some of its impact along the way.

It's easy to relate to her choices, and no matter how flawed she comes across, you want to root for her. Additionally, the creepy setting of a morgue, where Megan must work alone, also lends to an excellent atmosphere for a horror flick. Yet, as much as the film sets up its lead character and premise, it completely wastes any potential it had to be a creepy watch. This becomes particularly evident towards its third act when it ditches any pretence of being different and goes all out with the usual horror tropes that have plagued the genre overall. A jarring score, lazy camera work and sloppy editing make almost all the scares increasingly predictable, to the point when you are waiting for the possessed woman to appear on cue, and she does. <br><br>Although the cast doesn't have anything new or inventive to play with, Shay Mitchell and Louis Herthum - as Hannah's father - put in the strongest work. Mitchell is particularly effective in the lead role, which only adds to the inevitable frustration when the film drops the ball and commits to the usual scares that have been synonymous with the 'possession horror' sub-genre. It also keeps changing Hannah's abilities as per the plot's convenience, with the hope of keeping the audience on the edge of their seats, but in reality barely masks its lack of direction.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story</strong>: In a dystopian future, the mysterious teen Hester Shaw teams up with a lowly historian Tom Natworthy and the outlaw Anna Fang as they take on a giant predatory city that threatens to consume other cities in its path.<br><br><strong>Review</strong>: Scale is impressive in a movie, if there is substance to back it. So when Peter Jackson decided to produce 'Mortal Engines', a film that is based on the books by the same name, you know it will be on a big scale and there will be enough substance to back it. However, that is not the case here at all. While the concept is unique and the first few minutes are quite entertaining as you discover just how the cities evolved to run on steam engines, the film starts to lag when the other characters are slowly introduced. <br><br>Given that the books have their own Universe, debutant director Christian Silver has tried hard to explain that and balance it with the stories of the characters. Alas, he could have done a much better job. Instead of trying to find balance, the filmmaker could have stuck with the spirit of the book, which already has a legion of fans. <br><br>Another thing working against the film is the fact that, while you’re dazzled by the stunning visual effects, you don’t really connect with the characters. Hugo Weaving as Thaddeus Valentine isn’t half as scary as a villain. Hera Hilmar as Hester Shaw, who daringly takes on the mission to kill Valentine, is also not enough of a bad ass when it comes to battling it out. Shrike (Stephen Lang), the undead robot, is more funny than scary as he chases Hester like a clueless zombie. The only character that shows any promise, Jihae as Anna Fang who leads a resistance group, is not as much a part of the action. <br><br>Considering there are four books in the series, there is obviously ample scope for a sequel. For the sake of the viewers, we hope the writers spend a lot of time on adapting it for the screen, because the screenplay was one of the weakest points in this one. From the team that brought us Lord of the Rings, the viewers will always hope for something incredible. We hope Jackson and company don’t disappoint in the next one. <br><br>","3.0","Positivo"

After a point, the exercise can get boring because the guy has been the butt of jokes even before he became a President. However, Michael Moore, in his documentary 'Fahrenheit 11/9' provides some much needed perspective as to how a ‘wrecking-ball’ of a personality could rise to become an American President. Moore tries to answer just why Hillary Clinton, the far more popular candidate, lost the vote. And he does not stop at that. Taking off from the loss of the Democratic party, Moore goes deep into the heart of America’s grassroots movements to show how Trump’s win, more than anything else, is about the failure of the Democratic party to keep its promises.<br><br>The filmmaker keeps the momentum going as he examines a bunch of incidents in USA including the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, the school shootings and the recent Teacher’s Strike to make a point about how, the severely affected working class is fighting back.<br><br>Darkly funny at times, the film has several moments when you can feel the sheer injustice being meted out to the people, especially when the filmmaker goes back to his town of Flint and takes on the governor over the water crisis.<br><br>Moore shines the camera on the changing political system in America, where neither Democrats nor Republicans are absolved, as he shows how a new wave of public representatives, mostly from the Democratic Party, are coming to the fore on their own and facing down big corporations. It also dismisses the myth that America is divided on the lines of race. It shows, through the several crisis that the citizens face, that the real divide is on social lines of rich and poor.<br><br>This is a movie that questions the current establishment asks whether the USA will turn into a fascist, racist state.

In a bid to get back at the corrupt Sherrif, he joins up with an enemy soldier John to fight for the poor. <br><br><strong>Review:</strong> Most people are aware of Robin Hood’s story, and how the outloaw took from the rich and gave to the poor. It has also been made into a movie several times, the last one starring Russel Crowe in 2010. So, it would take something refreshing on the part of filmmaker Otto Bathurst to make the story exciting. While he has nailed the casting, with Taron Egerton and Jamie Foxx in leading roles, a slow-paced storyline robs the film of any excitement. Given the fact that this is an origins story, there could have been more to Robin’s tale. Instead, the filmmaker assumes you know Robin’s backstory. Because of this, it gets tough to believe or relate with Robin as you accompany him on his tedious journey two-hour-long journey. .<br><br>Academy award winning actor Jamie Fox seems completely wasted in his role as the Moorish commander who trains Robin. The entire training sequence could have been made better. What we get instead is Robin magically picking up superlative archery skills. Taron Egerton as Robin Hood seems to be the only actor whose performance is enjoyable, maybe because he has the best lines. Ben Mendelsohn as the evil Sheriff is not one bit menacing. <br><br>The best part of the film is the chase sequence involving a horse chase; a violent and edge-of-the seat spectacle that runs for almost ten minutes. Besides that, the action is unbelievable. No number of enemies are too much for Robin, as Rajinikanth-like he keeps shooting an endless stream of arrows from his quiver. Their final heist, also, is dull and uninspiring which leads to a weak climax. <br><br>While the filmmakers have kept enough room for a sequel, producer Leonardo DiCaprio will have to be one brave guy to make a second film. He’d much rather get better writers and consider another reboot. <br><br>","2.5","Negativo"

She must hack the US intelligence to retrieve a file that grants one access to nuclear arsenals. However, things go awry when a gang of dangerous Swedish assassins called the spiders, get into the picture. They also remind Salander of her dark past. <br><br><strong>Review:</strong> After the Swedish films starring Noomi Rapace and David Fincher’s 2011 American adaption, Claire Foy steps into Rooney Mara’s shoes to reprise the cult gothic vigilante Lisbeth Salander. Fede Alvarez’s continuation of the series is packaged more as a modern action thriller than the investigative and complex mystery you’d expect from the franchise. <br><br>Here Lisbeth is more of an indestructible Jason Bourne like spy than the dark and brooding hacker you’d like her to be. She helps women fight abuse as opposed to having mysterious motives. <br><br>While the reboot scores on action comprising car chases and a speeding sexy Ducati, what you sorely miss is the haunting unravelling of crime and mystery. It makes Lisbeth look like a Bourne, Bond or Salt successor, who can fight anyone and everyone, ride cool bikes and infiltrate or decode any security systems that exist across the globe. It strips her off her unique character traits and flaws that make her interesting and different in the first place. <br><br>While the plot keeps you invested in the film, after a point it just gets too commercial and convenient for your liking. Claire Foy, the third actress to play Salander slips into her significant role with great conviction. Though her character is simplified and Hollywoodised for no good reason, the actress retains its original mystique and aura. <br><br>Overall, The Girl in the Spider's Web makes for an engaging watch as a stand-alone crime thriller. It even tones down the brutal violence a bit. But as an extension of Stieg Larsson’s Millennium Trilogy (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series), this falls short of living up to its true dark vision and image. <br>","3.5","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Based on a true story set in the 1960’s, Green Book is a road movie that captures New York bouncer Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) and African-American pianist Dr. Don Shirley’s (Mahershala Ali) unlikely friendship. The film follows the two as they embark on a journey of a lifetime that confronts racism, intolerance, loneliness and understanding in an era of segregation in the United States. <br><br><strong>Review: </strong>Peter Farrelly’s delightful little film is all heart and a sure shot Oscar contender. It uses humour to touch upon an issue as unsettling as racism and leaves you moist eyed with its observation and understanding of human behaviour. Uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time, the story has the ability to change your life and how you look at people. <br><br>Though simplistically explored, the story portrays Vallelonga’s initial flawed sense of entitlement and traits exuding white supremacy and Shirley’s tussle with his true identity. He wonders where he actually belongs as an elite black musician who lives in a palatial house<br>— alone. His art is appreciated by the rich but not his skin colour. He rightly questions, “So if I’m not black enough and if I’m not white enough, what am I?” The film holds a mirror to our psyche and our knack of stereotyping people and how in the end; love, respect and kindness is all we need.<br><br>Shirley hires tough talking Vallelonga as his chauffeur to ensure no trouble during his concert tour in the Deep South. The Italian American bouncer wonders why Shirley endures racial abuse, until he realises, “Genius is not enough, you need courage to change people.” Those wondering, Green Book, titled after the The Negro Motorist Green Book, was a guidebook published for Black travelers that named services and establishments that were safe for them during a time of legalized discrimination.<br><br>The concert trip that lasts for two months makes both Tony and Shirley study their own behaviour and question their own beliefs. They change each other for better. Humorous, humane and heart-rending, Farrelly ensures you become the characters you watch. You feel their sorrow, love and humiliation. <br><br>While the film is effortlessly soul-stirring, a scene in particular sums up the movie brilliantly. Mahershala Ali sitting in front of a mirror after being bashed up by racists for entering a bar meant for white people. With tears in his eyes, he quietly uses a concealer to cover his wounds, just the way Shirley uses his music to hide his loneliness and inner turmoil. Ali deserves a standing ovation for this film and that scene in particular. His eyes do the talking.<br><br>Green Book speaks of embracing differences, overcoming prejudices and knowing what matters the most at the end of it all. <br>","4.0","Positivo"

Reilly) are very comfortable in their individual games and enjoy hanging out with each other. But Vanellope is bored of being in a predictable game where she wins every single race. To surprise her, an enthusiastic Ralph builds a new track during one of her races. But the game console breaks when her real-world player is unable to handle the new challenge. This puts the 'Sugar Rush' game out of commission, and all the characters are now forced to find new homes. Vanellope and Ralph set out into the Internet to find a way to fix Sugar Rush so that everything can return to normal. <br><br> Building on the undeniable charm and affability of its two main characters, ‘Ralph Breaks the Internet’ attempts to take its story to a whole new realm when they are faced with all the hurdles that can be found online. Considering that they have been largely restrained to the confines of their game worlds, they discover the digital world has more to offer than they ever imagined. As they venture out, they also learn a lot about themselves and their friendship along the way, especially when threatened by viruses and spam that prove to be deadly. Of course, this is a Disney film, so the kid-friendly filters are well in place. But there’s still room for older audiences to enjoy themselves. The most ‘mature’ humour arises from the studio bravely taking pot-shots at some of its own characters – especially the tropes associated with all their fairy-tale worlds. The performances rendered by the lead cast Reilly and Silverman hold the narrative together. Yet, this story is primarily driven by Silverman’s Vanellope who comes into her own in this sequel. Silverman makes you invested in Vanellope’s journey, even more so than Ralph, in the best way possible for the film.<br><br> It’s hard to shake off Gal Gadot’s distinctive voice as the new character Shank, who struggles to fit into this world, although that’s no problem for Taraji P. Henson’s Yesss. Meanwhile, there are ample other smaller characters and multiple references to Disney properties that fill the screen with Easter eggs in fun sequences - look out for a bunch of cameo voices as the princesses. It does suffer from a case of ‘how much is too much’ with a run-time that could have been trimmed a little, no thanks to a screenplay that tends to wander off course. It might not have the surprise elements of the original, but ‘Ralph Breaks the Internet’ is a thoroughly enjoyable visual treat for children of all ages.<br><br><br><br>","4.0","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>A Private War Story: </strong>The real-life story of Marie Colvin (Rosamund Pike) who sacrificed her personal life and put herself at risk to become one of the most celebrated war correspondents of our time.<br><br><strong>A Private War Review: </strong>In this biographical drama, ‘A Private War’ has the mammoth task of portraying the gruesome realities of battle while showcasing the difficulties of coming back to a life of comfort. As a foreign correspondent, Marie Colvin pushed the boundaries of war journalism to bring hard-hitting stories of human suffering from the depths of war-torn areas. She also suffered from PTSD, and constantly struggled to maintain her relationships while abandoning any hope of having a family of her own. Her friends and colleagues tried to understand what drove her to go back to the field. But as the title implies, she was so harrowed by human suffering that she felt compelled to tell the individual stories of those affected by war. This came at a massive personal cost – as ironic as it sounds, Marie could not find peace outside of a combat zone.<br><br>Rosamund Pike dives headfirst into the role, without over-dramatising or downplaying Marie's passion. By staying authentic to Marie’s reckless abandon and gruff exterior, Pike skillfully peels off those layers to reveal the real damage underneath it all. However, in the effort to maintain an honest outlook on Marie’s life, the film tends to meander slightly when off the battlefield, leading to some narrative casualties. During those scenes, it helps to have a rock-solid cast with the likes of Tom Hollander, Stanley Tucci and Faye Marsay. But the most surprising performance comes from Jamie Dornan as Paul Conroy – Marie’s photographer on the field. Dornan reveals he has more shades to his acting repertoire and his interactions with Pike are most compelling. The platonic relationship between Marie and Paul is rife with genuine concern for each other, especially as Paul’s background in the army becomes crucial to help Marie identify, and deal with her PTSD.<br><br>Besides her story, the film also feels the need to be a neutral spectator, taking neither a pro- or anti-war stance. Herein lies its tribute to Marie, in how she did not focus on the religious or geopolitical motivations of war, but only on the toll it takes on humanity. This distinctive approach comes from director Matthew Heineman, whose experience filming documentaries is put to good use. Marie Colvin was a profoundly driven, yet flawed individual, and Heineman doesn’t shy away from putting her personal demons on full display. ‘A Private War’ is filled with brutal, powerful images that will stick with you well after the movie is done, and succeeds in paying homage to a woman who put her life on the line while documenting others.<br><br>","4.0","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'><b>Creed II Story:</b> Adonis Creed faces his biggest test when he takes on Viktor Drago, the son of Ivan Drago.<br><br> <b>Creed II Review:</b> After winning the light heavyweight boxing title in ‘Creed’, Adonis tries to balance his personal and professional life when he’s challenged by Viktor Drago. Viktor is the son of Ivan Drago – (Spoiler Alert?!) the man who killed Apollo Creed in the ring all the way back in ‘Rocky IV’ (1985). Now Adonis needs to dig deeper to find the strength and resolve to avenge his father’s death. This 8th installment in the ‘Rocky’ franchise is torn between drawing from the history of all its predecessors while having its own clear identity. If it wasn’t evident before, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) has now been primarily categorised as a mentor/ father figure. Yet, the film still feels a need to follow the beats now familiar with this boxing series.<br> <br>What might surprise you is how you are compelled to care about the Dragos. There’s a pathos to both Ivan (Dolph Lundgren) and Viktor (Florian Munteanu) who aren’t treated as typical antagonists. Their backstory addresses an intriguing question – what happens to the bad guy after he fails? Dolph Lundgren gives a nuanced performance that communicates a lot, without saying much. Playing his son Viktor is a considerable responsibility for newcomer Florian Munteanu, but he’s convincingly menacing. If there’s one actor who has come into his own this year, it’s Michael B. Jordan who infuses Adonis Creed with the intensity and vulnerability needed to convey a myriad range of emotions through the course of the film.<br><br>However, while trying to invest more into its character arcs, the screenplay slacks across various points, often falling prey to the standard nature of its very premise. Worse still, the actual fights are unimaginative and all too forgettable. Sure, there are ample sentimental moments, but they’re quite predictable. The hardest blow falls on the relationship between Bianca (Tessa Thompson) and Adonis; pivotal scenes between them fail to hit home as much as they should, despite Tessa Thompson’s substantial efforts. Chalk this all down to uninspired writing; an average film-goer might be able to guess how the film will pan out. And yet, strong performances combined with the sturdy, albeit measured direction by Steven Caple Jr., ensure that although ‘Creed II’ often comes across as formulaic, there’s no shame in enjoying it for nostalgic reasons.<br>","3.5","Positivo"

The Conleys hope that the facility’s chief, Victor Sykes (Joel Edgerton) will be able to cure Jared of his sexuality.<br><br><br><strong>Review:</strong> There’s an old saying that’s quite popular the world over, more so in the US, which says, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’. Homosexuality is not a disease and as much as orthodox religious beliefs and people will vouch for a cure, the truth is, sexuality isn’t a problem, it’s a choice. Boy Erased is a film on this social and moral predicament. It’s based on a memoir by author Garrad Conley. A young boy is sent to a controversial program after his orthodox Christian family learns that he may be gay. Actor Joel Edgerton returns to direct a film that works on creating terror out of seemingly normal circumstances, where young boys and girls are subjected to an emotional ordeal at a facility that’s nothing short of a concentration camp. Backed by some powerful moments and solid performances, Boy Erased, tells a relevant and solid story, especially for those who have a perspective on the LGBTQI community. And for those not inclined towards sexuality, the film has some provoking thoughts about religion and the maxims attached to faith.<br><br><br>Jared’s father, Marshall is a preacher in the local church, while his mother is just as conservative about her Christian beliefs. Naturally, his parents are dealt a huge shock, when Jared comes out as gay. He’s swiftly dispatched to a conversion program where Victor Sykes and his dubious partners conduct a camp to cure children of their sexual deviancy. The scenes featuring a ‘geno-gram’ chart where kids are asked to label the sins of their immediate family members and the sequence where an introvert boy is literally beaten at a mock funeral of his homosexual alter-ego are deeply disturbing. The other, prominent aspect of the story deals with the way parents cope with their children’s sexuality. That’s where Russell Crowe and Nicole Kidman’s characters come to the fore. While both seasoned actors give top-notch performances, the emotional bond or lack of it, between the parents and Jared, sort of hinder the film’s prospects, albeit briefly.<br><br><br>Young Lucas Hedges is good right through his role. He gets the confusion and the melancholy of the part bang on. Edgerton and Red Hot Chili Peppers’ bassist Flea, are most terrifying as the conversion program’s leads.<br><br><br>Edgerton’s direction is taut and effective during the tense senses at the facility where the silences feel eerie and the homophobia seems unnerving.

The focus firmly shifts from Newt Scamander and weighs down heavily on Grindelwald and his devious plans. The plot then veers away from what made the previous entry charming and fascinating; that is, those fantastic beasts. This is a much darker and grimmer film, perched largely on the shoulders of two of the most recognisable members from the ensemble cast - Johnny Depp & Jude Law. Depp gives his most menacing and restrained performance, thus infusing the adequate amount of intrigue into Gellert Grindelwald - one of the most feared and powerful wizards in the Potter universe. Equally fascinating is Grindelwald’s relationship with Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law), and how the fate of the world largely depends on the latter’s reluctance to engage with his former friend and ally. Law’s charismatic turn as the beloved wizard carries potential as he is bound to play a more significant role in the sequels to come. ‘The Crimes of Grindelwald’ makes it evident that this is the story of his past. <br><br> However, writer J.K. Rowling is also committed to serving the Potter fandom which results in a vast number of narrative strands that become tedious to follow. Characters previously introduced now fall by the wayside in subplots that don’t seem to have much weight within this film itself, as they’re all seemingly invested in future returns. Thus, Newt Scamander’s character arc bears as much consequence as a footnote, which is a disservice to Redmayne’s skittish and endearing portrayal of Dumbeldore’s former student. There’s also the looming question of Credence Barebone’s (Ezra Miller) heritage which asks more questions than it answers. <br><br> While there are ample references to Hogwarts and cameos to satisfy fans, ‘The Crimes of Grindelwald’ has a lot of dense exposition that’s bound to baffle others. Director David Yates tries to balance this out by making the action set-pieces engaging, but the transitions from the character conflicts to CGI sorcery are clunky at best. All the dazzling imagery and ominous atmosphere can’t shake off the feeling that this is more setup than a standalone entity. However, it appears the training wheels have come off, promising that the next entry in the ‘Fantastic Beasts’ saga will go full throttle into J.K. Rowling’s world of wizards. If nothing else, that's bound to ensure Potterheads will stay tuned to the franchise.<br>","3.5","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Bohemian Rhapsody, (named after the band's signature song) is a biographical musical about the British rock band Queen and their frontman, one of the greatest singers of all time — Freddie Mercury. Navigating Freddie’s tumultuous personal life and the band’s meteoric rise, the film recounts the events leading up to Queen’s iconic Live Aid performance at Wembley in 1985. <br><br><strong>Review: </strong>You know a biopic works, when it casts a spell on you, engages you in its world irrespective of your liking or indifference towards its real life characters. It doesn’t matter if you worship them or haven’t heard a Queen song yet; Bryan Singer keeps you glued to your seats throughout as he lets Rami Malek channel his inner Freddie Mercury with astounding precision. Malek reprises Freddie’s unmatched singing-songwriting talent, showmanship, passion for music, flamboyant fashion sensibilities and ability to draw in the audience with a diva-esque swag and conviction. <br><br>Singer’s conventional narrative smartly oscillates between the band’s formation, music, success and disagreements as well as Freddie’s inner conflict and simmering loneliness. He seamlessly interweaves Queen’s biggest hits (in Karaoke fashion for you to sing along) with Freddie’s constant quest for answers — on identity, sexuality, love, friendship and a sense of belonging. Though the story keeps you hooked, Rami Malek’s Oscar worthy performance outshines it all. His spectacular act makes Bohemian Rhapsody a film about Freddie Mercury more than the Queen. He infuses soul into the movie and not for once you wonder if Sacha Baron Cohen had been a better choice given his sharper physical resemblance to Freddie. <br><br>While the film touches upon Freddie’s early years (born as Farrokh Bulsara, he came from a Parsi family that had roots in India), homosexuality, relationship with fiancée Mary Austin, the woman who inspired his ‘Love of My Life’ ballad and his eventual succumbing to wild ways, this is a film strictly made for the fans and thus is a tamed version. Those expecting to dig deep on 'Freddie the freak or Freddie the fag' (in his words), will have to settle for what’s already out there. <br><br>What then makes this musical a poignant piece of cinema are its masterful use of devices. Brilliant casting (every actor resembles the character he plays), heartrending performances, soulful songs, emotional confrontations especially the scene between Freddie and his father and heart-breaking anecdotes. “We’re (Queen Band members) four misfits who don’t belong together. We’re playing for the other misfits. They’re the outcasts, right at the back of the room. We’re pretty sure they don’t belong either. We belong to them.” The film wants you to remember the band and Freddie, the way they would want you to and though manipulative, it works.<br><br>As Malek takes centre stage in the final Live Aid act as Freddie, the director gives you a glimpse of the moments before he takes the podium. The camera follows him like a shadow. It captures his nervous energy, his pulsating drive to entertain once again and the fighter that Freddie Mercury was. There was more to him than his nonconformist, outrageous and wild shindigs. Bohemian Rhapsody celebrates his undying spirit beautifully through his music. From exploring Freddie’s take on mixing genres, innate desire to taking risks, not wanting to ‘fix’ his teeth to doing the good deeds — this one’s an uplifting tearjerker! <br>","4.0","Positivo"

How can the Grinch ensure he gets some peace and quiet while Whoville celebrates? Why he’s going to take matters into his own hands, of course! Along with his trusty dog Max, the Grinch plans to steal all the decorations and gifts from the entire town in one single night, and toss them off into an abyss. This re-imagining doesn’t deviate too much from the original story but adds some subplots and characters to give it a bit more flavour. Animation wise, Illumination knows precisely how to make their characters visually endearing as evident by everyone’s favourite Minions. They create a broad canvas by making Whoville larger-than-life, then filling it with a lot of tiny details and a splash of colour that gets you right into the spirit of Christmas. And that’s really what this film is all about. <br><br>There is a timely and relevant message on kindness and acceptance that’s firmly rooted in the screenplay. This becomes evident towards the third act and gives the film more to look forward to than merely having a bad guy trying to burst everyone’s happy bubble. Cindy Lou Who, voiced by Cameron Seely plays a crucial role in this aspect. Benedict Cumberbatch has a lot of campy fun voicing the Grinch, and he goes all out to embrace the grouchy and grumpy character. There’s a slight menace to his take on this character, but Cumberbatch also adds some heart to the otherwise pessimistic persona, and that’s when the movie pulls on your heartstrings just a little bit.<br><br>As long as they can sit through the first two acts, this gives something for adults to look forward to. Otherwise, the interactions between the Grinch, his dog Max and a huge reindeer Fred lend to the most entertaining moments. Pharrell Williams as the narrator speaking in rhymes from the original book adds a nice touch that threads the film. While 'The Grinch' isn't exactly groundbreaking or fresh, it has just enough Christmas magic to justify another modern retelling of an old story.<br><br>","3.5","Positivo"

The sets are elaborate, the action quite dramatic and the air battles are quite decently executed. The only problem is, it’s all surface-level. The pieces don’t fit together quite well. The Chaos looks beautiful but there is no method to the madness. Breathtakingly CGI fights in the sky, at times, have nothing to do with what’s happening on the ground. The timelines of the two stories that play out are muddled up which makes it tough to enjoy the action.

Clara is suddenly immersed into this world where she needs to find the key, but also restore peace and harmony across the Four Realms.<br><br>A princess who doesn’t know about her true status, toys that come to life, kingdoms at war with each other, and lavish, extravagant costumes; despite having all the makings of a classic fairy-tale, Disney’s ‘The Nutcracker And The Four Realms’ clearly falls into the ‘misfire’ category. Known predominantly to be a musical presentation, this rendition practically skips that approach altogether to focus on visual pageantry, a gimmick that soon outlasts its welcome. Despite all the eye-candy, the film is utterly dreary with little character to drive a predictable plot. <br><br> Even though the cast boasts of multiple Academy Award winners Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren, they appear to be sleepwalking through a mundane script. Keira Knightley tries to infuse some enthusiasm into Sugar Plum but ends up being sickeningly sweet. Despite Mackenzie Foy’s best efforts to make Clara a spirited girl trying to find her place in the real, and fantasy world, she’s weighed down by groan-inducing dialogue that’s all exposition and little heart. As a result, these characters are as interesting as an army of toy tin soldiers, and you know there’s a major problem when the most charming creature is a CGI-rendered mouse. This grand mess seems to be a case of too many cooks; co-directors Lasse Hallstrom and Joe Johnston fumble with a convoluted plot that’s riddled with glaring holes throughout. Devoid of any thrills and excitement, it’s doubtful that even the core younger audience will be engaged enough to sit through this one.<br>","2.5","Negativo"

But life deals her a difficult hand where she has to fly to Chandigarh to cover not one, but five weddings if she wants the top job at her fashion magazine. To add to her dilemma, her mother asks her to track her father, who left them when Shanaya was a little girl, and deliver a parcel to him. Like a good reporter and a dutiful daughter, she bites the bullet and flies to India where she bumps into Harbhajan Singh (Rajkummar Rao), a police officer assigned to liaison with her and stops her if she steps out of line and files a negative story. It may be tough to step out of line covering weddings for a fashion magazine, but Shanaya happens to chance upon the sorry way that transgender or Hijras are treated in India and decides to write a critical piece on it.<br><br>It would have worked out better had the filmmaker focused on one Indian wedding instead of five because the numbers don’t add a lot to the plot besides one or two incidents. Shanaya embeds herself very loosely with the weddings which make the story seems less believable. She is also not shown spending much time with the transgender community to get any credible story which she is shown writing.<br><br>The chemistry between Nargis and Rajkummar is unconvincing. While easily Rajkummar pulls off his role as a cop who is torn between his love and his work, Nargis doesn’t bring much to the table.

A Navy SEAL team on a reconnaissance mission is tasked with rescuing him. Deep underwater, a US submarine categorised as a ‘Hunter Killer’ investigates the disappearance of a lost American sub, when they discover a damaged Russian submarine and take their crew as prisoners of war. They receive orders to enter treacherous Russian territory and help the SEAL team with the extraction of the Russian president.<br><br>The submarine is captained by Joe Glass (Gerard Butler) who is given the aura of being a tougher-than-nails, no-nonsense leader, or effectively, almost every other Gerard Butler character. But he subverts that expectation in a restrained performance. Michael Nyqvist, in one of his last roles before his demise, brings a war-weary and insightful aura to Captain Andropov. His interactions with Captain Glass are fascinating as the two skippers share a tense yet humane kinship. There are some moments of intrigue created when the two rival captains encounter each other. Back at the command room, Gary Oldman’s trigger-happy Admiral Charles Donnegan barks orders at everyone, which gets hammy pretty quickly. Although he serves merely to raise the stakes, this is Oldman at his bombastic best, or worst, depending on how much you can bear. Meanwhile, we’re also expected to genuinely care about the team of Navy SEALS lead by a macho Bill Beaman (Toby Stephens), because they’re the ones at the front of the line in the rescue mission.<br><br>At the outset, there are many sub-plots to juggle between; made worse by tonal shifts in each area of a convoluted screenplay. However, those are the least of its problems. While there’s some excitement towards the final act, the film takes painfully long to get going by investing a lot of time in its setup. ‘Hunter Killer’ also belongs to an alternative reality where Russians speak heavily-accented yet fluent English, and the American president is a woman. As far as creative liberties go, there are bigger atrocities committed to film, but these disconnect you from all the intended seriousness. Based on the 2012 novel ‘Firing Point’, most of this premise comes across as another tired excuse for 'good ole' American patriotism to save the world. In theory, ‘Hunter Killer’ has a lot going for it, but instead, we get unintentional movie mayhem that’s bound to test your patience along the way.<br>","3.0","Positivo"

A sequel to 2015's 'Goosebumps', this installment too, is based on children’s horror book series by the same name but has a fresh story. Although it does employ monsters from the book series. While 90s kids will identify with it and may get a bit nostalgic, they will not find a lot to catch their interest in this film given that it is strictly for kids. A clean, almost funny horror comedy, 'Goosebumps 2' is more on the lines of 'Night at the Museum', but instead of historical figures, there are monsters that are brought to life.<br><br>While the story line will engage kids, grownups will find their attention wavering, 'Goosebumps 2' is predictable but fun. The animation on this one is top notch. Writer Rob Lieber of 'Peter Rabbit' fame has scripted a decent story, tied all the loose ends and left more than enough room for yet another sequel. The casting is bang on and Jeremy Ray Taylor and Caleel Harris essay their roles well as two bullied boys trying to right a terrible mess that they have created. Madison Iseman kicks some righteous butt as the older sister and gives a credible performance. Jack Black as the author RL Stine makes it count in his appearance which can only be called a cameo. The movie could have been made better had he been given more of a role to get in on the action and battle the monsters. It could also have been better if there was more of smaller characters like Ken Jeong, the childless and childlike neighbour who is wickedly excited that his monsters from his favourite horror novel have come to life.<br><br>For the Halloween season, this is a legitimately fun movie outing for kids, but not that much for adults.<br><br>","3.0","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'>Halloween Story: Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) faces an old foe who returns to haunt her and her family forty years after her first encounter with the masked killer, Michael Myers.<br><br>Halloween Review: In 1978, John Carpenter’s ‘Halloween’ established the slasher genre of horror films, wherein a disturbed person or group of people use knives, hammers, & other such fun tools to hunt down and hack away at hapless victims. Back then, ‘Halloween’ focused on an element that terrified a lot of us as children by taking the boogeyman out of our collective imaginations and putting him into the closet where he was lurking to get us. The impact of Carpenter’s ‘Halloween’ was often imitated but never duplicated, even by its sequels. Fortunately, this new version goes back to the basics and ramps up what worked forty years ago. The iconic soundtrack, the spooky atmosphere and Michael Meyers’ familiar mask are all back to torment Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). <br><br>But she’s had some time to prepare – in fact, obsess over her attacker for four long decades. That harrowing experience changed not just her life, but also that of her daughter, Karen (Judy Greer), in how Laurie’s paranoia affected her childhood and upbringing. Over the years, this has alienated Laurie from her daughter and to some extent, her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak). This slasher excels when it plays on their fractured family, because it explores the psychological aftermath of a trauma survivor, and Jamie Lee Curtis absolutely owns the role. She brings depth to Laurie, making us care about her past and how it has affected her. Furthermore, Laurie’s insistence on being vigilant and overcautious is integral to the storyline, and wouldn’t work if not for the veteran actress. <br>If only the film had dedicated more time to this dynamic, ‘Halloween’ would supersede its prequel. However, some awkward sequences don’t fit into the proceedings. There's a twist that is downright abysmal and seems to have been included merely for a shocking segue that doesn’t even last very long. Too many side characters crowd the narrative especially when they don’t add much overall, and instead, distract from the main plot. Fortunately, director David Gordon Green has the good sense to steer the film back to a tense, and satisfying climax. By ignoring all the other entries in the franchise and firmly connecting to its original, ‘Halloween’ revives an almost forgotten sub-genre and gives fans a <i>bloody</i> good time. <br><br><br><br>","4.0","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>First Man Story: </strong>First Man follows American astronaut Neil Armstrong over the nine years leading up to his historic trip to the Moon on July 20, 1969. As Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon — the film traces his state of mind during those tumultuous years of personal loss and professional hurdles. <br><br><strong>First Man Review: </strong>Damien Chazelle (La La Land, Whiplash), the youngest recipient of the Best Director Oscar, reunites with Ryan Gosling and music composer Justin Hurwitz to deliver a heart pounding emotional drama. This spiritual nail-biter alternates between Armstrong’s life on ground and in space to understand the man behind the name, fame and glory. <br><br>Chazelle’s storytelling masterfully juxtaposes Armstrong’s grief, thrill and uncertainty in a way that commands your unflinching attention. From nerve-racking space turbulence to deafening silences, Justin Hurwitz’s melancholic yet liberating score stirs the soul. <br><br>Based on James R. Hansen’s book, the film is essentially a cathartic human drama and not a commercial space adventure as one would assume. Chazelle doesn’t focus on the thrills of space travel, though it is an integral part of the film and its spectacular climax. Instead, he stares into the soul of Armstrong as he grapples with the loss of his daughter, friends, co-pilots and the things he didn't say when they were around. The astronaut turned to his work not only for his passion for space exploration but also as his only source of healing. More than his space missions (Gemini 8, Apollo 11), Chazelle romanticises his elusive personality, lonely existence and realistic approach to life. He makes you look at Armstrong the way he looks at the Moon. <br><br>With a cold, steely gaze, Gosling portrays his stoic character with remarkable restraint. Be it Armstrong’s frustration, inner turmoil and suppressed emotions, he lets his eyes do the talking. Claire Foy plays Janet (Armstrong’s first wife) with equal maturity. Her confrontational scenes with Gosling exude her character’s quiet resilience. She shows why Janet was much more than a supportive wife. Watch out for the scene where she points out the irony of her life to a friend, referring to her husband's ‘disorienting behaviour’. 'I married Neil because I wanted a normal life. He seemed stable unlike the other boys. I wanted stability.' <br><br>First Man is immersive, intimate and meditative. It unfolds at its own pace and there lies its beauty. Also, characters seldom resort to words to express themselves, which makes it all the more riveting. <br><br>Some films stay with you for eternity. This one transports you to the moon and back and is as special and introspective as the man it intricately studies but rarely reveres. Brilliantly crafted and hypnotic from beginning to end, First Man is a stunning piece of work that leaves you thinking about it, way after it's over. <br><br>","4.5","Positivo"

But the rest of the world doesn’t see how his alcoholism has a taken a toll on him over the years. On a drinking binge after a concert, Jack comes across Ally (Lady Gaga) at a bar and is impressed by her singing. Ally confesses that despite her undeniable talent she’s been told she doesn’t look good enough to make it big in the music industry. Inspired by her, Jack works on one of her original compositions, coaxes Ally to perform with him live on-stage, and the resounding praise they receive launches Ally’s career. The two also fall in love with each other, but Jack’s addiction catches up with them along the way.<br><br> Originally made in 1937, with remakes in 1954 and 1976, this is the fourth version of ‘A Star is Born’. ‘Aashiqui 2’ (2013) is also based on the same story. This tale transcends generations and languages because it ticks a lot of storytelling boxes – a famous star on a downward spiral; an underdog overcoming adversity to make it big; two talented people who can’t help falling in love with each other – we’ve seen variations of them all, several times before. But director Bradley Cooper, who co-wrote the screenplay, reconstructs the film for the present age. He focuses on each character’s emotional journeys and the impact they have as they intersect. A musical works best when its songs go beyond sheer entertainment value and add emotional depth to the narrative. As a trained singer, Gaga’s vocal range and tonal quality shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone, neither should her ability to tell a story through song. But the vulnerability in her acting and singing performances convey a raw sensitivity that defies her status as a real-life pop star. When a strong cast and palpable, intimate chemistry between the lead pair is added on top of that, the result is sheer movie magic. <br><br> Despite being engaging throughout; the film feels a little stuffed with a run-time of over 2 hours. The numerous subplots also require ample attention, but some pivotal character beats get brushed over and don’t resonate as much as they should. This becomes evident especially around the second act, and a tighter edit would fine-tune the intended impact. Nevertheless, ‘A Star is Born’ has enough goose-bump inducing moments to shake off any hangovers of its predecessors, largely thanks to an astounding original soundtrack. Bradley Cooper has something new to say in this version, and Lady Gaga belts it out loud and clear to make this a definite contender in numerous categories during awards season.<br>","4.0","Positivo"

His mistake? Taking on Carlton Drake – a businessman who considers himself to be a visionary, albeit with sketchy morals. Not to be outdone, Brock tries to probe into Drake’s shady activities when he encounters a mind-reading extra-terrestrial being that fuses with him giving him extraordinary powers. Brock is now left to choose how he uses his newfound abilities. If there was any doubt that Tom Hardy was best suited to take on the dual personalities of Venom/ Eddie Brock, they quickly dissipate once the interplay between the two begins. Hardy has handled roles that require him to juggle between personas, and he demonstrates all his prior experience here. Once ‘possessed’, Hardy infuses a playful yet dark aura to Brock that works well to bring some frenetic vigour to the film. <br><br>But the screenplay doesn’t allow us more insight into the moral conundrum going through his mind. This proves to be frustrating when you know that the actor behind the role has more depth and range than the script allows. In fact, it seems to be concerned mainly with stomping from one plot point to the next, which gets tedious. The dissonance between the characters and the plot points are painfully evident during the awkward conversations they have with each other; particularly between Brock and his ex-girlfriend Anne, featuring Michelle Williams in a baffling casting choice. Why hire a decorated actress if you don’t know how to maximise her skills? The same can be asked of Riz Ahmed who trudges along in villain mode as just another bad guy who wants to change the world because ‘reasons’. <br><br>What the screenplay lacks in character development, it makes up for in at least a couple of the action scenes which are well staged and executed, save for the anti-climax when it all converges into a massive CGI blob, quite literally. All hope isn’t lost though. A mid-credits scene does enough to build excitement for the subsequent sequel, which hopefully will feature Venom being integrating into the Spider-verse. If nothing, Tom Hardy proves that he’s more than equipped to play the sentient symbiote, but in the hands of a more adept director implementing a tauter story. <br><br><br>","3.0","Positivo"

Also unlike most Hollywood chick flicks or romcoms, this movie adaption lends emotional depth to its characters and understands why they say what they say.<br><br>For instance, Eleanor’s skepticism about her son’s girlfriend doesn’t solely stem from Rachel’s ordinary background. Her thinking mirrors society’s age old outlook towards women. If a woman isn’t willing to pick family over career, she isn’t good enough. <br><br>Other than showcasing the sights and sounds of Singapore and a girl’s struggle to fit in, the film subtly speaks of breaking norms and accepting people for who they are.<br><br>Comprising an all Asian American cast, the film focuses on the region’s (Asia) wealth, which is refreshing.

Her courageous tale of hope, dreams, desire and the unflinching human resilience captivates your imagination despite its unhurried pace. It’s a moving ode to her lush green home state and its beautiful people. <br>Those who prefer stories to unfold with a sense of urgency may find their patience tested here though. Das’s narrative takes its own time to establish the characters and the minutiae of their everyday life. Through gorgeous cinematography and audiography that masterfully captures the sights and sounds of Assam, Das transports you to Dhunu’s world of dreams and duties. A world which reminds you of your privilege. A world, where a mother bravely tells her daughter what inspires her to keep going despite their misfortune. “Hard work is the only thing we have,” she says. <br>While the film demonstrates the dilemmas of poverty, the tone and theme of the film is anything but tragic. Deep down, it’s a heartening tale of courage and our pursuit of happiness. <br>Other than its visual and emotional excellence, what stands out the most is Das’ powerful writing that showcases gender equality and strong female characters. Dhunu’s inspirational single mother raises her daughter just like her son. She stands by Dhunu and fights the society, who coerces her daughter to ‘behave like a girl’. The women don’t hesitate to undergo the social, physical and psychological hardships that men are expected to endure to put food on the table. <br>Village Rockstars is heartbreaking and uplifting in equal measure.

Slick smartphones, immersive virtual reality (VR) and social media are not his weapons of choice. He would rather fight with tried and tested tools. This premise creates ample opportunities for a laugh riot, and Kerr exploits them well. Watch out for a total ‘laugh out loud’ sequence where the virtual world meets the real one, as Johnny goes on the rampage through central London, wearing VR glasses. This is just one of many such fun moments.<br><br> <br><br>At 63, Atkinson looks unbelievably fresh and agile for his part; whether he is burning the dance floor or chasing a leggy Russian lass in a vintage Aston Martin.

In the film, the Yeti community leads a sheltered life, nestled away on a snowy mountain top, above the clouds in the Himalayas. Migo (voiceover Channing Tatum) is a happy-go-lucky Yeti, who is happy to follow his father Dorgle’s (voiceover Danny DeVito) footsteps in becoming the village’s future gong ringer. One day he accidentally runs into a human and is amazed to discover that a ‘smallfoot’ really does exist. The news is met with scepticism and incredulity by the tribe’s leader Stonekeeper (voiceover Common), who banishes Migo from the village. The rest of the film follows the gentle giant’s journey as he searches for the elusive smallfoot and the adventures undergoes as he discovers humans and their way of life. <br><br>The unlikely friendship between Migo and the human Percy (voiceover James Corden) is heart-warming as both come to terms with the other’s quirks and character traits, and discover the meaning of true friendship. Director Karey Kirkpatrick has given enough screen space to the supporting characters as well — Migo’s supportive friends Meechee (voiceover Zendaya), Fleem (voiceover Ely Henry) and Gwangi (LeBron James) — who have some of the funniest lines in the movie. <br><br>The animation is delightful without being over the top and the makers give out two messages to children — the film’s main audience — that if you persevere and set your mind to something, you can achieve it no matter how many roadblocks you encounter. And no matter what has happened in the past, humans can co-exist with other species if they really want to. It also makes one question whether being blissfully unaware is a boon or bane. With catchy songs and fun moments, the film is enjoyable although the length does get a little tedious towards the end. The script is pretty straightforward and will keep kids entertained although it may not find many adult takers.<br>","3.5","Positivo"

And thanks to years of training and gathering ammunition from across international borders, Riley's character is beefed up enough to put up a stellar show. But, that is not the case here. The screenplay is predictable and put together in an insipid fashion, and Garner is somewhat of a misfit: she tries to inculcate grit and gumption to her otherwise bland character, only to look docile and vulnerable . <br><br>The squeamish writing and Garner’s unmissable hamming makes it any other half-hearted, run-of-the-mill revenge saga. 'Peppermint' is one of those movies that is riddled with ridiculous clichés and the crucial twists and turns in the diegesis come from a dangerous territory: lazy writing.

The narrative is packed with a few subplots and characters that seem to do little other than highlight McCall’s endearing humane side.

The plot also travels from Boston to Belgium and back, connecting McCall’s past and present, but a lot of revelations are predictable. References to McCall’s own brooding backstory connect the dots for those who missed part one. However, there is no escaping the long run time that would’ve benefited with some more action and tightening. While there is an elaborate climax with heavy duty gunfire exchange replete with blood and gore, the hurricane backdrop could’ve been avoided.<br>All in all, Equalizer 2 is cut from the same cloth as one and packs in quite a few punches.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>The House with a Clock in Its Walls Story:</strong> A young orphan goes to live with his eccentric uncle when he discovers a whole new mysterious world of magic.<br><br><strong>The House with a Clock in Its Walls Review:</strong> Set in 1955, a recently orphaned Lewis Barnavelt (Owen Vaccaro) moves to Michigan to live with his uncle, Jonathan Barnavelt (Jack Black). It soon becomes evident to Lewis that all is not as it seems with his peculiar uncle, and the house he lives in. He finds out that Jonathan and his neighbour Florence Zimmerman (Cate Blanchett) are a warlock and witch respectively. Fortunately, they’re far from sinister although they are surrounded by evil forces, evident by a constant ticking in the walls. Lewis gradually studies witchcraft, while quickly learning that magic is no child’s play.<br><br>Director Eli Roth is known for his far more gruesome horror flicks, but that sensibility mostly works well here in his first children/ family film. Roth merges a sense of mystery with childlike wonder while maintaining an underlying feeling of dread because all is not what it seems. Adding to the film’s personality are Jack Black and Cate Blanchett – an odd pairing that works well precisely for that reason. You wouldn’t usually picture them playing off each other, yet they bring soul to the film with their platonic chemistry. Both actors venture towards camp but never fully into it. Black in his own unique style, lends his spirited and mischievous energy to Jonathan, complete with mandatory jamming on a musical instrument. Blanchett is deviously delightful as Florence, poised yet ruthless when needed. Their playful bickering alone could carry the film further than the script allows. Meanwhile, child actor Owen Vaccaro is a bit of a mixed bag; suitably conveying the distress of a lonely, awkward orphan but unable to maintain the right measure of emotional outbursts needed to make him believable.<br><br>The film also suffers from severe tonal shifts especially with humour that doesn’t always work. The final act commits to CGI mayhem with some genuinely absurd visual effects. However, the biggest issue is - although based on a novel released in 1973, the magical-fantasy themes remind you of other popular franchises, with hardly anything new or inventive on offer here. Still, the spirited combination of Black and Blanchett along with gorgeous production and costume design, make this an entertaining family adventure.<br><br>","3.5","Positivo"
"<div class='Normal'><b>Destination Wedding Story:</b> Frank (Keanu Reeves) and Lindsay (Winona Ryder) are two unpleasant people who meet each other on their way to a wedding, and begin a relationship of their own.<br><br> <b>Destination Wedding Review:</b> You’ve seen the format before – two people who can’t stand each other eventually start to have feelings and consider the consequences of being together. While that reads like a good rom-com flick, ‘Destination Wedding’ takes a whole different approach to the premise. Both Frank and Lindsay are anything but your standard lovable couple. They’re pessimistic to the point that they have rejected all the goodness in their lives. This goes against the casting grain for Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder who are both inherently likeable actors. Their respective characters meet en route to the said wedding; Lindsay is the ex-girlfriend of the groom and Frank is his brother. She is a basket case whose romance with Frank’s brother didn’t end well. Frank is a misanthrope who doesn’t see the purpose of relationships. In fact, the only commonality they share is that they are both entirely closed off to falling in love. <br><br> All of this sounds like the perfect setting for a delightful indulgence where the lead pair can’t resist each other, eventually giving in to the destiny that love presents. But writer-director Victor Levin chooses to take the road less travelled. He focuses the entirety of the film on making them so unpleasant that you’re left wondering why anyone would seriously consider being involved with them, to begin with. This is particularly the case with Frank who seems to have virtually no redeeming qualities and is emotionally stunted by his existential crisis. On the other hand, Lindsay is a romantic at heart, disillusioned by the shattering experiences she’s had in prior relationships. The sole reason to watch these two actors is their undeniable charm that shines through despite their dysfunctional characters. <br><br> But that can only go a short distance, especially when the actors are going through volumes of dialogue that sound too fabricated to be real. It certainly doesn’t help that they have no conversation with any other actors in the film; a bold directorial choice that falls flat because it further alienates the audience from the pair rather than bring us closer to them. There’s not much humanity to be found in this cynical outlook, and although marketed as a romantic comedy, there’s too little of either to warrant a trip to this ‘Destination Wedding’.<br>","2.5","Negativo"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>The Predator Story: </strong>When the universe's most lethal hunters return to Earth, it's up to a ragtag crew of ex-soldiers to defend the planet.<br><br><strong>The Predator Review: </strong> Director Shane Black is eager to address why anyone should pay to watch yet another foray into the 'Predator' franchise and wastes no time to jump into the thick of the action. He grabs your attention from the opening frames and doesn’t let go till the very end. The pace moves at a breakneck speed, and even the necessary exposition has a thick layer of humour slathered on it. This is prominent when we meet the bunch of ‘new age’ macho men led by Boyd Holbrook as Quinn McKenna. Keegan-Michael Key is far from the solitary comic relief; the film’s quirky tonality allows the rest of the cast including Thomas Jane, Trevante Rhodes, Alfie Allen and Sterling K. Brown to express their comedic range, and they all appear to enjoy it immensely. Olivia Munn as evolutionary biologist Dr Casey Bracket has little science, and a lot more gun-toting to do. Jacob Tremblay continues to build an impressive resume of playing challenging roles as a child actor.<br><br>The problem with Shane Black’s tonal approach is that the overtly masculine humour comes with a tinge of misogyny that feels exceptionally outdated in 2018. Sure, it can be argued that this ragtag bunch of ex-soldiers are mentally unstable, so it’s a far stretch to expect them to be politically correct under the circumstances. But the constant barrage of jokes doesn’t always work, especially when we’re supposed to feel a sense of terror for the looming ‘Predators’ and the mayhem they bring. This becomes a problem when more serious consequences occur after all the blistering fight sequences. Make no mistake though – ‘The Predator’ pulls no punches and lays it all bare when the bullets and limbs go flying in quick succession.<br><br>This keeps you glued to the story as it unfolds even though the plot is riddled with holes, often asking more questions than it answers. Re-shoots are glaringly obvious especially as the disjointed climax ends up being a whole different narrative beast. Director & co-writer Shane Black seems more keen to reclaim the magic of 1987’s ‘Predator’ than tell a strong, self-contained story in itself. Whether it is enough to ensure the next chapter in the franchise is yet to be seen – depending on whether you choose to spend on a ticket for this one. Rest assured that if you're looking to revisit the testosterone-fuelled grandiosity of the 80's, this is the closest you'll get to it.","3.5","Positivo"

They quickly realise they are up against something well beyond their understanding when they encounter ‘The Nun’. Centuries ago, this evil entity was fended away by divine forces but is unleashed once again through human folly, now seeking to cross over into our realm. This being wreaks havoc with the intent to invade all that is good and pure – as any self-respecting foul being is prone to do. No points for guessing the religious significance of the demon; the title is a dead giveaway. ‘The Nun’ is steeped in Catholic imagery making for impactful visuals. <br><br>The unsettling atmosphere forms the strongest aspect of the film. A place of worship defiled by malevolence is a powerfully disturbing notion, and ‘The Nun’ capitalises on it as much as possible. Graveyards are spooky enough by mere existence, and the dark interiors of sprawling castles equipped with murky spaces add to the setting. The background score is garishly gruesome, signalling dangers lurking around the corner. However, it’s a shallow well that quickly runs dry because the script and screenplay are devoid of a genuinely fearful threat. The story is conveyed in the form of theological exposition that might appear substantial but is pretty much the same formula explored many times before in the genre. <br><br>Furthermore, the lead characters are devoid of any personality beyond their mission at hand, even though actors Demián Bichir and Taissa Farmiga are committed enough to give all they can muster. Most of the blame lies in non-existent logic, as the movie’s primary purpose seems to drive one jump scare after the next. Sure, the first few appearances of the so-called Nun are disturbing, but her presence soon becomes endurable because there’s not much depth to her. Combined with misfiring humour, courtesy a French-Canadian who is inexplicably settled in Romania, the film's tonality is also in jeopardy. Beyond a point, 'The Nun' follows a standard template as it relies solely on the eerie soundtrack and discomforting vibe, ending up being derivative. Little wonder then that it quickly loses steam, although it is bound to frighten those with a low tolerance to horror flicks.  <br> <br><br> <br><br>","3.0","Positivo"

Small films can leave a deep impact and this is one such incredible story that addresses the most pertinent question of today — whether our need to document our lives on social media is a boon or a bane? <br><br>Chaganty infuses technology in a classic whodunit, to give us a taut mystery that unfolds on computer and phone screens. This innovative storytelling technique makes you a part of David’s search operation instead of being a mere spectator. Every call missed, key pressed or text read, brings a lump in your throat, almost mirroring our reliance on technology in our daily lives.

This film is the remake of an original feature released in 1973, based on Henri ‘Papillon’ Charriere’s autobiography. As the story goes, Papillon, played by Charlie Hunnam this time around, is a thief sentenced to life imprisonment after being framed for murder. On his way to jail, Papillon befriends fellow inmate Louis Dega (Rami Malek), a rich man convicted of fraud. Papi, as he’s fondly called, promises to protect the weaker Dega in exchange for funds to secure their escape out of their secluded facility. Their plans are thwarted continuously by guards and a warden who merely seeks to break down his inmates rather than rehabilitate them. <br><br>This game of wits sets the tone for the film; what follows is a harrowing mix of triumphs and setbacks for Papi as he plots his escape amidst escalating challenges. Hunnam is up for the task of documenting the unbelievable plight of a man repeatedly pushed to the edge of madness, especially during solitary confinement. Oddly enough, the script is so bland that director Michael Noer ends up downplaying important segments. Instead, he focuses on the meticulous recreation of Paris in 1933, and the cinematography returns the favour with some luscious images amidst the dire circumstances of prison life.<br><br>This proves to be an eyewash when the concept of the film hinges on exploring mental tenacity. Even the foundation of Papi and Dega’s friendship feels rushed, and we’re meant to merely accept that they would sacrifice their sanity for each other. Granted, the chemistry between Hunnam and Malek (who is criminally underutilised) is brimming with promise, but it never comes to fruition, which ends up being frustrating with a runtime well over two hours. The result is a tedious watch that is occasionally engaging but never fully immerses you into the nuances of a persistent mind, making this a lukewarm remake<br><br> <br><br>","3.0","Positivo"

It  is made interesting by throwing in legions of bad guys on motorcycles as they shoot up Silva and his team. Action wise, the film reminds you of the Bourne series. However, this time, the one doing the skillful hand-to-hand combat is Iko Uwais (from 'Raid'), the Indonesian John Abraham! He’s a human Swiss knife who can take on scores of enemies while handcuffed. It’s ironic that he is the target to be saved because he clearly doesn’t seem like a guy who needs much saving.<br><br>While the action is slick and the hacking technology employed will make any one nervous, there is a huge element of monotony in the film. The hail of bullets, after a point, becomes white noise as you wait for the plot to unfold. There is an interesting takeaway, but the overly simplistic plot spoils that. <br><br>At a time when espionage films are becoming more realistic with complex characters, Mark Wahlberg’s act one-dimensional act as the angry, foul-mouthed agent seems rather lazily written.

Thankfully, current movie technology nullifies that outdated nugget of wisdom, evident here as ‘Alpha’ captures what's meant to be the first incident of humans befriending wild wolves. The harsh and unforgiving landscape of the Ice Age forms the backdrop to this fictional tale as young Keda (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is injured and left for dead after a mishap during a hunting expedition. While trying to make his way back home, he befriends an injured wolf, and they both must fight the elements and other predators to survive the ordeal.<br><br>Smit-McPhee is tasked with most of the acting duties, and the young actor proves he’s capable of holding his own as the star of the film, along with his charming co-star. Granted, the factual accuracy is up for debate – for instance, the amount of time taken for trust to grow between Keda and his canine companion is greatly exaggerated, but these cinematic liberties are acceptable within the realm of what the film seeks to achieve. The story itself is relatively straightforward which might get predictable, but it works as an origin fable of how dogs became ‘best friends’ to humans. It’s also a coming-of-age tale of a young boy’s painful journey into adulthood while imagining how a sense of caring for a species other than our own came to be. Although that premise might sound sugary, the tonality of this movie is hardly saccharine, and it doesn’t shy away from showcasing some of the brutalities of prehistoric times.<br><br>But this Ice Age is also envisioned by director Albert Hughes as a time of great natural beauty; lovingly captured in some breathtaking vistas of Europe 20,000 years ago. Vivid colours blended with stark, barren lands create a sense of wonder that’s magnified in IMAX 3D. Even though the plot is hardly innovative, there’s enough spectacular cinematography and technical wizardry on display for discerning viewers to be significantly engaged by ‘Alpha’. But this gritty and heart-warming fictional backstory to one of the most unique relationships we share with our furry friends makes it essential viewing for every dog-lover.","4.0","Positivo"

Based on the fairy tale Ruslan and Lyudmila by Russian poet Aleksandr Pushkin, 'The Stolen Princess' is Ukrainian 3D animated fantasy film that tells a simple story in a delightful manner. There are no epic twists and turns as it’s a classic tale of love conquering all obstacles, but the way the characters are fleshed out and the light humour present throughout the film makes it a fun watch.<br><br> Made on a lean budget, the film’s animation is rendered refreshingly well; something Indian studios must take note off. While each frame is not packed with multiple characters and complex graphics, the animation standards are up to the mark. The land of magic, where the princess is held hostage, has been rendered rather well. Ancillary characters like the cat that transforms into a huge beast, and the bird and hamster that help Ruslan on his quest break the monotony in the story and keep the action going. There are some truly funny scenes including the epic pastry fight that stands out. <br><br> The voice acting is top notch and so are the dialogues, and the film can be enjoyed by kids and grown-up’s although the latter may find their attention wavering as there are some dull moments.

'The Meg' is no different with its straightforward premise. Hollywood's obsession with sharks date all the way back to 1975, so this film is mainly an excuse for Jason Statham to take on a massive shark underwater. A big enough action star like Statham calls for a decent budget to be committed to this endeavour. This is evident as the CGI is a few notches higher to make it appear better than a B-grade flick.<br><br>Jason Statham knows exactly what he signed up for, and he has the right amount of fun playing Jonas Taylor, a retired rescue diver who is called back into action. Statham's training as a diver comes handy here, and he commits to the role with a sincerity that does the film a huge favour. Chinese actors Li Bingbing & Shuya Sophia Cai have interesting chemistry with each other and are the only actors besides Statham to watch out for. The rest of the cast is practically redundant, and therefore dispensable. The screenplay doesn't give the audience much to care about – the sentimental scenes don’t resonate too deep, and the comedy doesn’t hit home either. So when the scenes don't involve sharks or the actors mentioned before, it's hard to stay focused on the proceedings.<br><br>Perhaps the biggest drawback is the writing which does not narrow down on the film’s tonality. There are points where it takes itself a little too seriously, and others when it aims straight for cheesy popcorn blockbuster status. Little surprise then that director Jon Turteltaub doesn’t know what kind of film he’s making either. The momentum picks up towards the end when the monster mayhem escalates to bigger proportions, but it turns out to be too little, too late.

Thirty years on, Robin (Ewan McGregor) is married and busy with his pencil pushing job in London. Out of nowhere, Winnie the Pooh appears in London to throw Robin off his schedule and adult responsibilities.<br><strong>Review</strong>: Once people grow up, they tend to get overwhelmed by the expectations and norms of adult life. The monotony of schedules and responsibilities take over and the joy of life is reduced to becoming a feeling of nostalgia. AA Milne’s iconic Winnie the Pooh and his friends have long been a reminder of childhood, playfulness and naivety. In this new film by Marc Forster, the treatment is dreary and even though this is a Disney production, the characters have washed out colours as the setting is grey and gloomy. But the crux of Milne’s original work is still there. The film repeats the line, ‘doing nothing leads to the very best kind of something’. The idea is to retain the child within and even when you’re an adult, you can still have fun if you seek out the childhood wonder.<br>Ewan McGregor sleepwalks through his role of a father and a husband, who does not have enough time for his family. He’s supposed to be an adult, who is completely disconnected with the child that he used to be, but his performance never brings the depth or the emotion to the character. What also feels a bit jarring is the fact that Pooh, Tigger and the other animal-toy avatars from Milne’s universe look worn-out and without the usual colours. It’s a device to depict abject realism and portray that grey feeling of adulthood, but somehow it doesn’t quite add to the appeal of the film.<br>Unlike Milne’s original work, Christopher Robin is not just a film for children. Robin’s wife Evelyn (Hayley Atwell) tells him that she hasn’t seen him laugh in years. That’s a clear as day hint to the ‘adulthood has made you boring’ idea. They way Forster’s film builds and delivers this thought is fantastic. The funny scenes of Robin, a grown man, wading through London crowds with Pooh’s simpleton observations and comments are a lot of fun. The scene where Robin’s young daughter Madeline discovers the joy of playing out in the open and exploring is also a nice nod to modern times.<br>The old school charm of the film, combined with the voice cast performances by Jim Cummings, Brad Garrett and Toby Jones make this movie memorable.

A series of events then sets her off on a mission to Europe along with her best friend Morgan, played by Kate McKinnon who brings her typical quirkiness to her character. She taps into her substantial experience as a comedic performer and uses it to hilarious effect. She almost manages to get away with some of the more ridiculous scenarios merely by acknowledging Morgan’s eccentricities. Mila Kunis doesn’t do anything new with Audrey, who is meant to be relatively conservative and unadventurous. But co-writer and director Susanna Fogel uses this 'grounded girl-next-door paired with impulsive wild child’ dynamic to the film’s advantage. <br><br>Amidst all the comedy and action, the underlying theme, besides survival, is the friendship between Audrey and Morgan. They go to great lengths to protect each other in dire circumstances which wouldn't work if not for the chemistry between Kunis and McKinnon. The film is also quite aware of how it promotes feminism and even has the nerve to joke about this repeatedly. In moments like these, it finds an enjoyable rhythm, helmed by its affable lead pair. The action is a lot edgier than expected; there are fight scenes and car chases that take you by surprise and supersede the laughs. In fact, don’t let the marketing fool you into thinking it’s a lighthearted comedy because this movie certainly doesn’t pull any punches. Sadly, this momentum fizzles out towards the padded final act when inexplicable developments become particularly hard to digest. <br><br>The run-time doesn’t work in its favour at this point, especially as some sub-plots become tedious, drawing your attention away from the main story. While its grittier than your average chick flick, the biggest drawback in 'The Spy Who Dumped Me' is that it doesn’t commit to one genre. There’s not enough action or intrigue that comes with a spy flick which becomes problematic when the humour fails to land. Still, there’s a lot of fun to be had with some surprises and enough laughs to keep you reasonably entertained.<br>","3.5","Positivo"

While 'Everest' was an out out story of how a group of climbers make it alive from their ascent, 'Adrift' has a bit of a romantic touch to it. In fact, it's starts out like a romantic film where Richard, a sailor by passion, meets Tami, a backpacker in Haiti.

During the ambitious voyage, the couple are hit by a full blown hurricane and have to make it ashore.<br><br>The fact that Kormakur plays with genres, namely romance and adventure, works both, for the film and against it. Their dreamlike love story where they sail under magical skies hits all the right notes. But at its heart, Adrift is a survival tale. And somewhere, the filmmaker focuses on the intensity of their relationship a tad more than he does on their heroic struggle to stay alive and fight the elements. But there's a payoff to that exercise too, and will definitely take you by surprise.<br><br>Music by Volker Bertelmann elevates the carefully crafted frames by multiple Oscar-winning cinematographers, Robert Richardson. Shaileene Woodely delivers a power packed performance as a happy go lucky person who has to match the might of an entire ocean.

But ‘Fallout’ manages to build on the previous films in the series by bringing back old friends and foes, besides adding some new ones. Henry Cavill as August Walker fits right into this universe as the hammer to the scalpel that is Ethan Hunt. His presence is looming enough to fill the entire screen whenever he appears. Simon Pegg takes on the status of a series regular alongside Ving Rhames, whose Benji and Luther respectively play more than just mere sidekicks as they add comic levity and heart. Alec Baldwin and Angela Bassett also make a mark in their brief appearances but watch out for impactful turns by Rebecca Ferguson and Michelle Monaghan along the way.<br><br>Writer & Director Christopher McQuarrie allows each character to shine while building on their history with each other, thus making them endearing to the audience. This only serves to up the ante when they’re in danger. McQuarrie also lets the story breathe by bringing some calm before the storm hits. Which leads to the most crucial aspect of the series, and one that McQuarrie clearly excels at in this film – the action sequences. Not only are they meticulously planned; they are executed with precision, even when the fist fights are gritty and gruesome. Rob Hardy beautifully choreographs the camerawork following these intricate set-pieces, either allowing you to take in the expanse or bringing you up close and personal when required. This is paired with a soundtrack by Lorne Balfe that lends to the tension by giving the iconic ‘Mission Impossible’ theme a sinister sense of urgency.<br><br>McQuarrie has now directed two ‘Mission: Impossible’ films; his understanding of the franchise and its characters proves to be the secret weapon of the series. The fact that the stunts are largely done with practical effects featuring the cast, and most prominently Cruise himself, sets a whole new standard for action films. ‘Mission: Impossible – Fallout’ is a great mix of plot, pacing and performances that is undeniably the best entry in the franchise, while it re-establishes Cruise’s status as an action superstar.<br><br>","4.0","Positivo"
