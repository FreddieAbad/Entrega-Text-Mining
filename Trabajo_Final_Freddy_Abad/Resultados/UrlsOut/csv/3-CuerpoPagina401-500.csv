"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Bobby Fischer was one of the greatest – if not the greatest – chess champions who ever lived. A complex character to say the least, Fischer’s gift came with a price; the genius was bundled along with paranoia and delusions. That however, didn’t stop him from setting his predatory sights squarely on then Russian chess champ Boris Spassky for the title of world chess champion.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> The film tells the true story of the notorious Boston gangster Whitey Bulger (Depp), who held sway over his territory with brutal efficiency. He is the brother of Senator Billy Bulger (Cumberbatch), who is pretty much the exact opposite of Whitey in terms of temperament. At his FBI friend John Connolly’s (Edgerton) urging, Whitey becomes an informant and helps the FBI nab various mobsters who also happen to be Whitey’s rivals. In exchange, John covers up for Whitey, protecting him from the law, while turning a blind eye toward the latter’s criminal activities.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Connolly and Bulger hail from Southie, a part of Boston where everyone knows each other and bonds run deep. He cares about Bulger and convinces him to slip the feds valuable information that can help make the town almost crime-free.<br>

Currently though, Cole is limited to doing free gigs and when paid, earns a pittance. Things change when he accosts James Reed (Bentley) who becomes his mentor. But apart from Reed’s talent, Cole also admires the latter’s girlfriend Sophie (Ratajkowski).<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Let’s start with what We Are Your Friends is not about, rather than what it is about. Despite slick visuals and stylish montages, this is not a go-to guide on how to become a star deejay. This story is far too simplistic, the characters unevenly explained and too many corners are cut.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Katia Van Dees (Ware) has been on the run almost all her life. Her mother was killed when she was just a little girl and her father abandoned her, seemingly in a bid to let her live, even as he had his own dangerous secrets regarding his work, hidden from the world. Now, as an adult, Katia tries to find her dad. Helping her – but not without his own agenda – is Agent 47 (Friend) a deadly assassin.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> If you are familiar with the Hitman video game series, you’ll have no trouble recognizing the titular character of this film by his attire – Italian wool black suit and crimson tie. He, along with many others like him are the product of a super-secret genetic experiment which involved modifying a section of a person’s DNA in order to enhance – as well as subdue – certain qualities. The resultant effect would imbue the modified ‘person’ with almost superhuman powers. Agent 47 knows no fear, feels no love, nor does he tolerate idiots or idiotic questions. Nothing and nobody messes with his given objective. In this case, his objective involves helping Katia find her father, an important figure who a group known as the Syndicate, headed by LeClerq (Kretschmann), want to capture and question.<br>

<strong>Review: </strong>She's Funny That Way is a charming little film which benefits from its quaint milieu. Peter Bogdanovich weaves in the element of simplicity and affability, characteristics conspicuous to him, traces of which we saw 43 years ago in his most memorable movie What's up, Doc?<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Former special-ops expert Frank Martin (Skrein) lives a quieter, less action-packed life in the present day. His day job involves transporting mysterious packages for clients on a strict ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ basis. Heck, he doesn't even want to know any client’s name. When the job is done and the cash is paid, the chapter is closed. He is approached one day by the gorgeous Anna (Chabanol) for a job. Soon, things take a dangerous turn and he also finds out his father (Stevenson) is being held hostage by Anna.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Frank Martin steps into Jason Statham's signature role in this new installment of the Transporter action franchise, to mixed results. Martin does his level best to act like and even talk in a manner that Statham almost patented, in the previous iterations of the movie. But while Statham looked like a genuinely rough-and-tough bruiser, Martin comes across as more at home on the pages of a fashion magazine. While his efforts are sincere, he’s not as effective as Statham.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><em><strong>Story:</strong> It is 1963 and the Cold War between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is at its height. Despite these diplomatic tensions, an agent from each of these countries – Napoleon Solo (Cavill) and Illya Kuryakin (Hammer) – have to work together to stop a shadowy group from getting their hands on a nuclear warhead.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> First off, it’s important to note that this movie is actually based on a popular US TV show from the post-World War II era. Back then, the spy genre seemed especially relevant given the tensions between the USA and the USSR and so, made great fodder for primetime TV. However Guy Ritchie has now updated the story line and infused it with a wry and dry sense of humour along with a generous dose of wittiness, all the while keeping the Cold War backdrop as a present-but-distant sideline.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> There is no escaping the fact that No Escape, despite all the bludgeoning, is a guilty pleasure you’ll be tempted to take. The loopy script ridden with shameful clichés ends up taking a backseat, as you get on this roller-coaster ride.<br>

When Ricki arrives home, she realizes she has a lot of ground to cover in terms of catching up with her family.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Even when off the stage and not singing cover versions with her band in a tiny pub to a small but appreciative audience, Ricki (her real name’s Linda) remains in black leather. She slurs and sways in Keith Richards-like rocker fashion and looks totally out of place in Pete’s sprawling, tastefully-furnished home. Pete however, has long since moved on with a new wife, Maureen (McDonald), who treats Pete and Ricki’s children as if they were her own.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> The Fantastic Four have been deserving of a reboot for a while now, in full contemporary style. This film however, feels like an extended, somewhat boring preamble to the kind of action and excitement audiences deserve to see, presumably in the next film in this series.<br>
<br>

Gordo becomes overly-friendly and showers the couple with gifts. Behind all the gift-giving though, is the memory of a horrifying past incident that manifests itself in the present day.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> You get the feeling that you’re in for a treat right from the first few frames of The Gift. Aided by Eduard Grau’s stunning cinematography (Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans’ chilling music score is superb too), Edgerton – who has also scripted the film – ratchets up the intensity with Hitchcockian skill.<br>

Their road trip however, is nothing short of disastrous, as they are beset at almost every turn during the journey, by various difficulties.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>While the film is supposed to derive loose inspiration from National Lampoon’s Vacation (1983), there are actually just a few similarities. For example, this version spares nothing when it comes to bawdiness and potty humour that can either hugely tickle your funny bone, or put you off, if naughty jokes don’t float your boat.<br>

It’s now up to Shaun, his fellow sheep and a few mates to rescue the Farmer, restore his memory and bring life to normal at Mossy Bottom Farm.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>For those of you who are new to these characters (the film is a feature-length excursion based on the children’s TV series, of the same name), it is important to know that there are no dialogues in the movie save the odd grunt or vocalization from a character or three meant to convey basic emotions. Additionally, stop-motion studio Aardman Animations (Chicken Run, Wallace & Gromit, Arthur Christmas and more) have kept things pretty simple and sweet - looks-wise - in the film. And that visual tenderness is matched by the simplicity of the story line itself. This is quite essential, given the lack of verbal content.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> We get an idea of the kind of limits Tom Cruise will go to, in order to entertain his fans, almost as soon as the movie begins. He clings to the outside of a cargo plane (the shot reportedly took eight takes) while in flight, as he desperately maneuvers to get inside the airplane and jettison a load of chemical warheads. The CGI/stunt double route could have been taken, but Cruise did it for real. Because he’s Tom Cruise.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> What do you get when you take a dollop of Adam Sandler-style goofball humor and supplement it with nostalgia-laden videogame visuals from the 1980s? Pixels presents a barrage of this and more that can at times, hammer on the senses.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><em><strong>Story:</strong></em> The famous boxer Billy Hope loses his wife, his property and his daughter after an accident. The film traces the story of how he gets back on his feet against all adversities.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Southpaw is a lethal concoction of drama and pugilistic action. The film’s bland scripting put its lead character through a circle of physical and emotional suffering. Jake Gyllenhaal skillfully moulds himself into the character of Billy Hope whose dwindling career in boxing is revived after life forces him to stand up for his daughter. Billy's character is quite that of a man child, who runs by the decisions taken either by his wife Maurie or his manager.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>To start with, the idea of a superhero character that can shrink down to infinitesimal size, become stronger the tinier he gets and command an infinite army of ants, sounds extremely interesting. Reed and team have crafted a superhero film that is not only action-packed (not excessively so), but also funny and thankfully devoid of bluster. At its heart though, this is a heist movie.<br>

Three of the four had attempted to vandalize the sets of their school play called ‘The Gallows’. A mysterious being – either real or supernatural – tries to prevent them from escaping alive.</em><br>

<strong>Review: </strong>The found footage horror sub-genre came into its own back when we saw The Blair Witch Project. There has been a clutch of films since then that serve up cinematic variations of found footage fare. Some work, some don’t. The Gallows lies somewhere in between.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Minions made their way into our hearts with the unabashedly hilarious Despicable Me in 2010. Five years on, these goggle-eyed yellow creatures take on the centre-stage in this origin-story flick with their gibberish blabber and their stock pratfall frolics to amuse us.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Although her vocal range embraced many styles, Winehouse was most in her element when she slipped into jazz mode. We hear her smoky, silky voice, often generously seasoned with scotch, singing with great emotion all throughout the film. Early on, a fresh-faced, street-smart Amy Winehouse wins over everybody she sings for, with her refreshing vocal style. She is helped along by her faithful friend and manager Nick Shymansky, who has her best interests at heart. It seemed almost inevitable that someone of Amy’s prodigious talent would become a big, Grammy award-winning star someday.<br>

Skynet, long since self-aware, is now even more powerful. And of course, Skynet will do everything to foil the Resistance. It boils down to a race against time to prevent Judgment Day.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>James Cameron’s Terminator became an instant action/sci-fi classic when it hit screens in 1984, with its chillingly bleak, dystopian vision depicting merciless machines wiping out humanity. John Connor was a beacon of hope then.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>If you have had enough of sugary pooch lovin’ in films, Max will be a refreshing watch that attempts to break away from the syrupy vein of its beat. Though laden with clichés and lacking suspense, the film thrives because of its stirring moments. The titular character of the hunky Belgian Malinois is sketched with subtlety, never getting overtly melodramatic. The story with its share of drama and action, at its core it remains a heartwarming tale about overcoming loss.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>The Bellas’ reputation is in shambles thanks to Amy’s out-of-control solo and mid-air wardrobe malfunction but from the ashes of their tattered reputation, Beca (Kendrick, in a decidedly endearing performance) makes a deal with their Barden College principal. The Bellas will be allowed to perform again in the country if they achieve the impossible – winning a singing championship in Copenhagen.<br>

He gets a second chance at restoring his career and reputation when he later investigates and tries to nab the person behind a series of gory killings.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> At the beginning of the film, we see Leo flirt with the sublimely attractive Raisa at a dinner table while in the company of friends during one post war party. He doesn’t mince words about how fine he thinks she looks. He is confident on the verge of being blustery. But she brings his feet back on the ground when she corrects him when he calls her by another woman’s name, by mistake. He has no idea about what a pivotal role Raisa will play in his life in the years to come, by which time the two are deeply in love and almost inseparable.<br>

However, Quinn learns that contacting the spirit world has some terrible consequences.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> The prequel to the successful horror series is helmed by a new director this time around, bringing you a mixed bag of treats, or scares, to be more appropriate. Surprisingly, there is even the odd joke or two (perhaps to ease the tension a bit during intense parts in the narrative) that might or might not work for you, depending on whether you prefer your horror fare to be dead serious.<br>

They now try to help Riley adjust to her new home while dealing with an emotional imbalance caused by Sadness.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>What will strike you immediately about this movie is just how novel the entire concept really is. Just like some of the really good animated movies we’ve seen in the past, this one quite literally has a cerebral angle (pun intended in this case!), so to speak. It puts the emotions of a child front and centre.<br>

The movie is about how they go about putting together this film, and the various issues related to it.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Fans of the TV series will have plenty to get their teeth into here, for this movie is for all practical purposes like an extended version of an episode with of course, plenty more details (and its own brand of hedonism for good measure) all thrown into the cinematic mix.<br>

<strong>Review:</strong> Every once in a while, there comes along a spy movie that straddles the line between not taking itself too seriously and not floundering in a soup of slapstick send-ups. Spy, with its female protagonist who looks and behaves like anything but a spy (seriously!) not only carries a feminist torch in terms of attitude, but is also aided by the kind of invective-laden vocabulary that would make a sailor blush.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Ari Sandel bases this story on Kody Keplinger’s novel of the same name and gives us a lighthearted yet telling look at the kind of peer pressure that some US high school students face. So systematic is the improvised ‘class system’ is that there are even innocuous-sounding acronyms designed to conveniently categorize peers into neat slots. Bianca has great grades, yet she doesn’t realize that guys are nice to her just to use her like a ‘gateway’ to approach her bombshell babe buddies Jess (Samuels) and Casey (Santos). Bianca has both wit and candor but she wears pajamas to school and is decidedly frumpy.<br>

And so, the ageing process is halted at a genetic level. Adaline reconciles herself with the fact that she will outlive everyone she knows and so, shuns love. Until one day, when Adaline meets the true love of her life.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> The whole idea of not ageing a single bit beyond the age of 29 would be enviable to many and the bane of the beauty industry. Adaline’s contemporaries are eternally curious about the secret of her everlasting youthfulness. “French face cream”, she hurriedly tells one, before rushing off. Adaline met with her accident in 1937 and – as a faux professor-like voiceover diligently informs us in the film– a moon phase had a combined effect on the tides of the ocean as well as an ionizing effect on the Earth’s atmosphere. To Adaline, being genetically frozen in time is a millstone rather than a miracle. An aberration that prevents her from having any kind of meaningful relationships because she knows she will outlive absolutely all of them.<br>

Doug and Abi agree to put their troubles aside and travel together from their home in London to Scotland, for Doug’s dad Gordie’s (Connolly) birthday.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin base this uniformly hilarious family portrayal on their BBC sitcom Outnumbered. Doug and Abi have their hands more than full with their three kids. The youngest, Jess, has a certain straightforwardness borne out of her tender age that pretty much cuts through any kind of nonsense. Precocious to the tee, adorable is an apt description for her. Lottie is the sharp-eyed observant elder sister who keeps a diary, noting down all sorts of day-to-day minutiae. And Mickey pretty much has a mind of his own.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: What’s the first thing you’d think about when the words ‘zombie movie’ and Arnold Schwarzenegger’ are put together? Arnie using a Gatling cannon to mow down the undead by the truckload? A body count rivaling the number of cast and crew in the film? Nope and nope. Instead, Hobson holds back on the blood and gore and goes for something more nuanced, underpinned by an atmospheric musical score (David Wingo’s compositions, sounding reminiscent of film score composer Cliff Martinez’ work).

If there’s one simple fact that the film clearly establishes during its expansive run-time, it is that humanity’s collective actions will have a direct impact on the days and years to come. And so, the world of tomorrow as depicted here can either be a post-apocalyptic disaster (climate change or nuclear war, take your pick) or a gleaming embodiment of mankind’s finest achievements.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Big Game is a film which, despite its hackneyed writing, is imbued with charm and humour. Yes, the plot-line doesn't really bow down to the logic of physics but the story’s endearing quality works as its saving grace. Jackson crisply slips into the role of the American President, who is struck by calamity mid-air, on his way to Helsinki. A ploy to get him assassinated falls flat when a young Finnish boy Oskari (Onni Tommila), who is on a hunting trip that will define his machismo to his community, finds him in the jungle and vows to save his life.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: Fury Road is a relentless, action-packed assault, with not a seeming nanosecond to spare when it comes to crash-and-burn chases involving vehicles that look like they were forged in the Devil’s own backyard.<br>
<br>
In this post-apocalyptic fable of reconstruction, Immortan (Byrne) rules from an HQ that looks like a steampunk junkie’s dream dominion. Immortan’s lackeys (War Boys) resemble zombies and are slavishly devoted to him. Max has been captured by them and is used as a blood donor for these War Boys. Furiosa, while in Immortan’s employ, goes renegade one day when she drives a supply truck to his HQ containing fuel and some ‘genetically pure’ handmaidens who are in Immortan’s harem. Two of these - Whiteley as The Splendid Angharad and Eaton as Cheedo the Fragile - are very effective. Max and Furiosa meet when an infuriated Immortan subsequently gives chase, with revenge on his mind.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story</strong>: Danny Collins (Pacino) is a loaded rock star who is addicted to the lifestyle that comes with it. He hasn't penned an original song in decades but keeps the cash rolling in by touring and relying on his old hits. He's got the trophy wife too, half his age. He is stunned one night when his faithful manager Frank (Plummer) gives him a letter that Beatles icon John Lennon wrote to him 40 years ago. Danny has an epiphany after reading it and decides to seek meaning in his life again.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: In undoubtedly his best performance in years, Al Pacino has taken this story – inspired by the true tale of folk singer Steve Tilston who received a letter from Lennon that wasn't delivered for decades – and elevated it to a whole different level altogether.<br>

Things go wrong during the journey with Cooper not knowing who to trust as the line between the good cops and dirty cops are blurred.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Vergara's Daniella is every cliché and stereotype of a bombshell Latina all rolled into one dress-bursting, outrageously sexy body. Reese's Officer Cooper cops a superior attitude and talks like she ate up a police officer's rule book when she was little. And speaking of little, the diminutive Cooper is only 5' 2” while the well-built Daniella towers over her. Physically, mentally and emotionally, they couldn't be more different. And they are lumped together for the ride from San Antonio to Dallas with Daniella trying every chance to escape as Cooper struggles to get her to Dallas the next morning by hook or by crook. Daniella's husband had decided to testify against kingpin Vincente Cortez (Cosio), but is shot by gang members before he can do so. He leaves behind a distraught Daniella who spouts the kind of cuss words that would make a sailor blush.<br>

SpongeBob (Kenny) forms an unlikely team with Plankton to recover the recipe, restore Bikini Bottom to normalcy and sate the appetites of its ravenous dwellers.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: If there are two words that best describe this often surreal serving of a movie, those would be – playfully deranged. All of Bikini Bottom is hooked on to whatever it is that comprises the stolen Krabby Patty's secret formula. Everyone thinks the thief is Plankton, who has a history of having his one (and only) eye on the formula. But SpongeBob teaches Plankton the importance of working together to achieve their common goal. After a few hits and misses, however, they get their friends Patrick (Fagerbakke), Mr Krabs (Brown), Squidward (Bumpass) and Sandy (Carolyn Lawrence) involved.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Josh and Cornelia pretty much have nothing to complain about the way life treats them, except for the proverbial white elephant in the room that they can't ignore – their lives as individuals and as a married couple, are empty. Their sex life is in the doldrums and they go about day-to-day tasks like automatons. So it's no surprise that when Darby and, more specifically, Jamie enter their lives one day after Josh winds up giving a lecture in a college, it's like a breath of fresh air. Josh and Jamie's 'bromance' blossoms and the former loves everything about Jamie – from his worn sneakers to his expansive LP collection.

It decides to kill the Avengers, citing world peace. The superheroes soon discover that Ultron intends to wipe out mankind itself. Can the team save the world from the mess of their own creation?<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Avengers: Age of Ultron is one heck of a superhero orgy as the mighty six - Iron Man (RDJ), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Capt America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) come face-to-face not only with the invincible Ultron, but various characters like Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany).

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> The film is set in the immediate aftermath of World War 1.

Eliza is mentally affected by the loss of her kids and Joshua is wracked with guilt for letting them go and fight in the war.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Crowe’s feature film directorial debut is an amalgam of two fairly distinct narratives blended together. One is Joshua’s trip to Turkey to unearth the remains of his children. A humble water diviner, he faces a lot of resistance in this regard from Captain Charles Brindley (Wyllie), an archetypal pompous officer. But the Australian (ANZAC) Lt-Col Cyril Hughes (Courtney, wonderfully nuanced and mustachioed) is willing to bend the rules. He also strikes up an unlikely friendship with Major Hasan (Erdo?an) of the Turkish Army.<br>

Many years later, Jacob, about to wed his fiancée Vittoria (Valverde), returns to his hometown to meet Buddy and stumbles upon a host of unpleasant truths.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Buddy is doggedly protective of his younger brother. It’s almost like this protectiveness is hardwired into Buddy’s simple mind as his core mission in life. Even as a child, he gives a share of his first paycheque (a few measly dollars) to his brother to purchase a violin. Later, Buddy would earn some serious money when he is trained (or rather, cleverly manipulated) by local crime boss Julius Hench (D’Onofrio) to become his hitman.<br>

This is pure masala stuff: some jokes that nobody really laughs at, some soppy sentimental drama that's occasionally funny and some paisa wasool action sequences with plenty of flying glasses and flying kicks.<br>
<br>
A couple of action sequences -- especially the one where the girls retrieve a hamburger in mid-air and where a coin is flicked to shatter a glass - are riveting. Hero Wu Jing, in the mould of Jackie Chan and Jet Li, and Sammo Hung, a big name in Hong Kong action flicks, are in top form. Martial arts buffs will get a kick out of this.

<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> There’s something unsettling about this film from the opening scene itself. The premise, as described above, reads plainly enough on paper. Jay's sister Kelly (Sepe) and friends Paul (Gilchrist), Yara (Luccardi) and Greg (Zovatto) empathize and try to help her.<br>

From the US to Azerbaijan, then Dubai and back to LA, the fight is, indeed, both fast and furious.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: Amazing stunts aside, James Wan (Insidious 2, The Conjuring) probably faced two big challenges when making this film. The first, crafting a movie that glorifies insanely reckless driving while also being sensitive to the fact that one of the leads (in a sad irony) died in a reckless sports car crash. Secondly, making a seamless film given the fact that Paul Walker - a name synonymous with this series - is no more. In both cases, he hits the sweet spot.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>First off, the most impressive aspect about Gunman is the obvious effort Penn (who also co-writes and co-produces) has put in towards building a buff physique. His Popeye-like, vein-rippled arms seem to have a life of their own. Apart from his T-shirt-tearing pectorals, Penn's real-life social causes also influence the film.<br>

Now a limousine driver with a family of his own, Mike drops off two clients to an apartment and is then witness to a murder committed by Danny. The latter tries to kill Mike in his house, but Jimmy takes Danny out just in time. When Jimmy telephones Shawn and almost casually informs him that he has killed Danny, there are no temper meltdowns. Instead, there's just a mutual resignation towards the inevitable; Jimmy tells Shawn that they are going to approach the point of no return. What we then have is classic Neeson – rumbling voice and lumbering gait – all the way.<br>

Fate drives Roman General Lucius (John Cusack) and his platoon for shelter with Huo and an uncanny friendship blooms between the two men separated by ethnicity, but brought together by destiny. Lucius has fled his homeland following a coup and seeks Huo’s help to save the crown prince Publius (Jozef Waite) from the evil designs of his treacherous brother Tiberius (Adrien Brody).<br>
<br>
<strong>Review </strong>: Chan’s Dragon Blade is a pleasant surprise, executed with visible grandeur and can claim to be an earnestly performed, crisply edited, smart fare. The movie primarily invests in attaining technical finesse to remain close to the widely understood connotation of commercial cinema. Forgoing the attempt to explore the frictional intricacies of Silk Route, the film’s slim understanding of its setting shows starkly in its tendency to avoid a political comment. But, what works in its favour is the satiating after-feeling which gives you bang for the buck.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Tris and Four have an odd dynamic. Tris is a hyper-emotional bleeding heart who either bursts into tears or snarls, while Four, true to Dauntless form, is the testosterone-raging, over-protective alpha male who literally keeps running after Tris when she gets upset, mouthing platitudes like â??I know what youâ??re thinkingâ?? and bashing up anyone who tries to mess with her.

<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> How to train your Dragon 2 should be studied by filmmakers to learn 'how to make a sequel'. For a change, it is not just a rehash or remake of the 2010 Oscar-nominated film. While keeping the spirit, titular characters and visual excellence of the previous installment intact, a new story, characters and plot twists are introduced to lend novelty to the proceedings. The makers manage to keep the high-flying action and pace impressively consistent. Not once do the scenes get sluggish. The 3D animation breathes life into the story, without overpowering it.<br>

<strong>Review: </strong>Whiplash explodes on screen like a well-timed artillery barrage. We’re introduced to the two characters in this movie that really matter in the opening scene itself. Illuminated by an overhead light, Andrew is seen practicing in an otherwise dark room at the fictional Shaffer Conservatory of Music.

With each determined step, Cheryl inches closer towards self-realization.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Wild benefits from a simple, strong and straight-ahead storyline; its multi-linear narrative offers us various perspectives, such as glimpses into various stages of Cheryl’s life prior to the present day, via flashbacks. These windows into her past about what could have and what should have been, still torment her.

<strong>Review: </strong>In 1989, Harry Burns professed his love for Sally Albright in ‘When Harry Met Sally...’ because ‘he knew whom he wanted to spend the rest of his life with and he wanted the rest of his life to start as soon as possible’.

<br>

<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Jupiter Ascending can be distilled down to a cosmic family tale involving planetary inheritances, sibling scheming, inadequately-explained references to genetic theory and plenty of action in between.

The film traces how he curbs his relentless gambling, fights his fears, let go off his self-destructive tendency and turn a new leaf in life.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>In terms of story, Wild Card seems to be extracted right out of blank pages. There is no story per se but a series of instances lazily strewn together. But what is striking here is that the deftness of Simon West’s unusual thrills doesn't allow the vital flaws get the better of the movie.

<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>The Boy Next Door is an exceedingly amateurish story fashioned as erotica, catering to cougars and juveniles. A bloated vanity project attempting to display JLo as the hottest 40-year-old, the film tries desperately to validate the obvious. Our 'older' woman-next-door is a looker and never regular - coffee hair with perfect curls, rightly slit skirts that accentuate her assets.

<strong>Review:</strong> Mark (Tatum) and John reside at either end of the wealth spectrum.

<strong>Review:</strong> It's a riveting portrayal of a fading superhero star who is used as a prop to understand the workings of prestige, power games and how fame's intoxication can soon wear out into futility and redundancy.

As the last man standing – or in his case, hunched over a bar stool in a tavern and nursing a pint of ale – he is now grizzled and old. Gregory is approached by his apprentice for a mission – recapturing Malkin, who has escaped her remote confinement from what looks like the medieval version of the Grand Canyon. While Gregory (whose warbling speech sounds like he has a mouth full of marbles) manages to survive various battles, his apprentices aren’t that fortunate. Gregory later turns up at Ward’s country home. The latter often has visions that are meant to convey that he can look into the future, and is according to Gregory, the one who can stop Malkin before the Blood Moon rises in the near future. Initially bumbling, Ward gradually finds his depth, along with a love interest in Alice (Vikander) who is the daughter of a witch named Lizzie (Traue). It all leads up to the final battle between Malkin and her monsters versus the Spook and Ward.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong><em>Mortdecai (Depp) is an art dealer who knows his Raphael from a Rembrandt. Almost on the verge of bankruptcy, his fortunes could however turn around when he is approached by the Mi5 to trace a valuable Goya, once captured by Hermann Göring, that contains a secret code to a treasure trove of Nazi gold. </em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>From the moustache down to his character’s bon vivant-isms, this is among Johnny Depp’s craziest and looniest screen outings. We get an inkling of this in the opening scene, where the debonair Mortdecai (with Oxford accent on fourth gear) meets three Chinese toughs for an art deal. Mortdecai has cheated them in the past and they now intend to collect. The meeting quickly degenerates into a bar brawl and it is Mortdecai’s manservant Jock Strapp (Bettany) who saves him from a premature end. And indeed, Jock (also shown to have a voracious sexual appetite) routinely saves Mortdecai’s ass throughout the movie.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><em><strong>Story:</strong> Stephen Hawking has a brilliant career and loving marriage ahead. But diagnosed with motor neuron disease, he's given two years to live - can Hawking solve the equation of life?</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>In 1963, Stephen Hawking was very far from the world-revered figure he is today. Instead, this biopic depicts Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) as a partying, rowing Cambridge student, interested in the 'physics of lust', bantering with buddy Brian (Lloyd). Hawking is brilliant but yawningly lazy, giving Professor Sciama (Thewlis) answers scrawled on train schedules, meeting Jane (Felicity Jones) at a party, the pretty languages student bowled over by the awkward, charming young man. Love's blossoming when Hawking is told he has motor neuron disease, his muscles will degenerate - and he has just two years to live. Jane insists on marrying Stephen - but their journey isn't simple.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>“Pay close attention. I will not pause. I will not repeat myself...” intones Turing (Cumberbatch) very early on in the movie. And so, indeed without pause or preamble, steadily unspools the tale of one of the most brilliant minds of modern times.<br>

<strong>Review: </strong>When Paddington (Whishaw) arrives in London (after he loses most of his family in a natural disaster back in Peru), he is initially lost in a sea of strangers and of course, a bit overwhelmed by the whole ‘bright lights, big city’ vibe. Nevertheless, he does have a taste for all things British (with an accent to match and a love for marmalade too) and stoically decides to wait it out at Paddington Station until hopefully, he will meet a family which will let him into their home and make him part of the family unit.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Cooper fires but Eastwood misses the mark</strong><br>
<br>
<em><strong>Story:</strong> </em>Known for his fascination for character studies, this time around, Clint Eastwood gets into the psyche of the late Chris Kyle, a Navy SEAL, proclaimed as the ‘most lethal sniper in U.S. military history’. Based on Chris’ best-selling memoir, this biopic follows the legend’s war service in Iraq and how it took a toll on his personal life.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Unnerving and tense, the trailer of this film opens to a remarkable scene, where an American sniper (Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle) is shown aiming at a suspicious woman and child in war-torn Iraq. The anxiety about whether he pulls the trigger brings a lump to your throat. It left us pumped up about the film and though it indeed comes close to meeting our expectations, somewhere, Eastwood’s biopic falls short of hitting the bull’s-eye, unlike its protagonist.<br>

Lenore is found dead in Bryan’s apartment one afternoon and is the cops’ chief suspect for her murder. But Bryan’s chief objectives are to find Lenore’s killers, protect his daughter and prove his innocence.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Mills is not your ordinary tough guy. He possesses deadly skills thanks to his military and CIA background, but is also extremely ethical and discerning about when and how to use those skills. His prime concerns are his ex-wife and daughter. And when someone messes with that, he as we’ve seen in the previous Taken movies, he finds them and eliminates them.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>The story begins in the 1950s. Beat poets and artists abound before the psychedelic explosion of the 1960s. Margaret is a freewheeling artist and has no sense of taking care of business, finance and how to value her work in money terms. Her life revolves around her art, and her only confidant in matters of life, love and more is her friend DeeAnn (Ritter). Margaret raises a daughter by herself as she is a divorcee.

The second, during the thick of WW II and the manner in which he and two crewmembers spent those arduous days in the shark-infested Pacific after the crash.

<strong>Review:</strong> The weirdness actually starts with the film name itself – what does 'Babadook' even mean? Is it a child's made-up word for a beast hiding under the bed or lurking in the shadows at night? Perhaps an entity from the land of nightmares or maybe a physical manifestation of Amelia's inner demons?<br>

<strong>Review:</strong> The Danish Girl is the kind of film that leaves by an unsettling feeling. It is almost like the world hasn’t evolved since 1926, considering we are still discussing Caityln Jenner’s highly publicized sex-change surgery and article 377’s relevance in the Indian scenario.

<strong>Review</strong>: Monster Hunt, although an acquired taste, is an interestingly different tale told keeping various Chinese themes in mind, in addition to various sight gags, martial arts (but of course) and some humour too. While the overwhelming majority of animation hits we’ve seen in the last few years have emerged from studios in the West, this kiddie-entertainer is certainly an ambitious outing for director Hui.<br>

<strong>Review: </strong>That Star Wars is a force to be reckoned with, is a given. It is a cinematic entity – a space opera – of such proportion that it has no parallel or comparison. But J.J. Abrams’ biggest achievement here is that he has successfully managed the daunting task of forging the beginnings of a new chapter in this franchise’s mythology. Tributes and references to the early films abound – some obvious and some not-so-obvious. For example, the ‘wipes’ that are used for scene transitions are delightfully (and deliberately) retro, and first seen in 1977’s A New Hope.<br>

This time, it is the charming Little Red-Haired Girl (Capaldi) who has caught his fancy, and Charlie will do just about anything to win her over. Meanwhile, Snoopy (Melendez) while not daydreaming about being a World War 1 fighter ace who battles the Red Baron, remains the good friend that he and Woodstock always were, to Charlie Brown.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Unlike some of the animation film franchises we’ve seen in the last few years, which are relatively recent creations, Charlie Brown and Snoopy (immortalised in the Peanuts comic strip) have a history that dates back to half a century. Charles M. Schulz’s immortal cartoon characters get a deservedly high-tech treatment here, while not sacrificing any of the original detail and nuances that made these characters so famous.<br>

Taiko finds out she has betrayed him (by working with the cops to bring him down) and wants revenge. She then finds herself trapped in an apartment where she has to battle wave after wave of Taiko’s goons.<br>

<strong>Review</strong>: Salma Hayek in her barest essentials, oozing tough-girl sexuality? Check. Salma Hayek in the skimpiest of clothes and with all guns blazing while mowing down bad guys by the truckload? Yes indeed.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story</strong>: Set in 1820, this is the story of a whaling ship that meets with disaster in the then-uncharted Open Ocean. Eager to fill the Essex’s hold with whale oil after an initially disappointing catch, Captain George Pollard, Jr. (Walker) and first officer Owen Chase (Hemsworth) are driven by greed to venture out into treacherous waters. It is poetic justice then, that one of the very creatures they are hunting wrecks their ship as well as the crew.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: This film is set in a time when things like ethical concerns regarding the brutality of whaling, were non-existent. Back then concepts like species being endangered probably didn’t exist. In today’s world, whaling is banned almost globally. But back then, as depicted in the film, whaling by itself was probably more dangerous for the crews than the whales. A large sperm whale could reduce the wooden ships then in use, to matchwood. And that’s exactly what happens here, when Pollard, Chase and their fellow sailors are dumb enough to try and bite off way more blubber than they can chew. When they set out from Nantucket and head on down the Americas to a spot of ocean 200 miles off their planned course, they find themselves in a veritable whalers’ paradise. But an alpha-male bull sperm whale proceeds to teach the sailors the lesson of a lifetime.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story</strong>: Ronnie and Reggie Kray (Hardy, in a double role) were to London what Al Capone and Meyer Lansky were to the US – feared gangsters who mixed illegal business dealings with violence, in equal measure. Apart from tracing their often tenuous brotherly bond, the film deals with their rise, celebrity-like status and eventual life imprisonment.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: The real life Kray brothers had a fearsome mix of street-smart wiles and keen business acumen. Reggie is the brainy, relatively more normal of the two while Ronnie is crazy to the point of being scary. Early on in the movie, a doctor walks up to Reggie, fumes that Ronnie is downright insane and that he should not miss his twice-a-day medication ever. Reggie though, is a gentleman and it is his chivalrous ways and good looks which draws the rebellious Frances (Browning) to him. She later marries him, despite not liking the fact that he is a gangster.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story</strong>: Millions of years ago, a family of dinosaurs lived together in their happy farm. Henry and Ida had three beautiful children - Libby, Buck and Arlo. The story traces the timid Arlo's journey from fear to freedom.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: From the first frame, you'll instantly lose your heart to the vividly animated, bright milieu here. Arlo's world is moulded with rich colours and the film's animation is one of the best in recent times. Some shots of the forest, the snow-capped mountains and the river are beautifully done. But, in terms of story, The Good Dinosaur suffers a beating. It is far from novel and the writing is lazy.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Adonis Creed (Jordan) is a strong-minded young man who, after getting a chance at changing his life for the better, seeks to hone his skills and channel his energy into boxing – something he believes he was born to do. When his efforts to find the best trainer fail, he seeks out his dead father’s old counterpart, Rocky Balboa (Stallone). Will Balboa take Creed Jr under his wing and train him for greatness?<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Every once in a while, there comes along a sports drama film that challenges odds and defies expectations – much like the hero of this film, Apollo Creed’s son. While Stallone has not written this film (as he did with the others in the Rocky series), Ryan Coogler makes deft work with this subtle, moving and nuanced tale of interpersonal relationships. The boxing scenes, therefore, only add to the emotional impact of the film. Confrontations in the ring serve as key points, but it is the parts in between that form the flesh and blood of this story. That said though, you will be hard-pressed to find a film that has better brutal pugilistic rounds than this.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong>The stage is set for a confrontation between rebel factions from the various districts, rallied together by Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence) and forces in the Capitol, ruled by President Snow (Sutherland).<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> What immediately makes this film more exciting than the previous installments in this series is that there’s a lot of action, a few scares too, and plenty of thrills to keep fans of this franchise well entertained. The only downside though, is an overly-protracted ending, which is reminiscent of how long the ending of the final Lord of the Rings movie was.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> So, Spectre is one of Bond's most thrilling action movies - but also one of his most ghostly, reaching into an eerie past. James Bond (Craig) is chasing 'The Pale King' (Waltz), head of criminal group Spectre, perpetrating terror on nations, forcing them to buy Spectre's massive surveillance network. Tracking the villain who killed his first love and first boss, Bond reduces parts of Mexico and London to rubble, smashes cars, helicopters and a plane, battles hideous heavy Hinx (Bautista), beds sultry Mrs. Sciarra (Belucci), nearly drinks vegetable juice and meets Madeleine Swann (Seydoux) - who downs dirty Martinis and shoots deadly hard.<br>

Neither Ray nor Jess will rest until the murderer is brought to justice, no matter how long it takes.<br>

<strong>Review: </strong>Billy Ray’s remake of Argentine director Juan Jose Campanella’s 2009 film stays pretty faithful to the original in terms of some of the basic themes of the movie, such as obsession, bits of paranoia and revenge. But this time around, the action takes place in Los Angeles. Set in contemporary times, while Campanella’s flick was set in the 1970s. Additionally, Ray’s version has a war on terror backdrop which adds to the film’s sense of dramatic tension.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Dracula’s (Sandler) concern these days is that his mixed blood grandson Dennis (Blinkoff) is more human than monster. His fears aren’t unfounded, as Dennis is after all the half-human and half-vampire son of Mavis (Gomez) and Jonathan (Samberg). Mavis agrees to let Dracula ‘babysit’ Dennis for a road trip, so to speak, along with Frank (James), Murray (Key), Wayne (Buscemi) and Griffin (Spade). Dracula and gang put Dennis through a ‘boot camp’ designed to make a monster out of him. When Drac’s curmudgeonly dad Vlad (Brooks) enters the scene, everything changes.<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> Backed by a delightful cast and animation effects that are thankfully not over-the-top and too gaudy, Hotel Transylvania 2 is subtly intelligent and is a film that even the adults among the audience will not get fidgety sitting through – thanks to some scary images, exciting action and rude humor – while the kids have a ball.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Emily (Hutchinson) and Leslie (Whitburn) are besties who embark on a long road trip in order to join some other friends for a party. As they hurtle along in their red Mustang on a lonely highway in the American Northwest, their journey takes a turn for the worse. They come across and are harassed by the driver of a big-rig tow truck. It soon becomes a matter of life and death for the girls.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> This film is said to be a take on Steven Spielberg’s 1971 TV movie Duel, but apart from borrowing the premise of road rage taken to the extreme, that’s where similarities end. Duel’s sole male protagonist is now swapped for two party girls, whose road trip is meant to culminate in a weekend of debauchery and fun. Leslie is the wilder one, who swallows ale and inhales weed with rapacious glee, even though designated driver Emily tut-tuts her and urges moderation. But Leslie has no patience – even for a lumbering tow truck that obstructs their speed and path – and bounces around in her seat impatiently like a simian on speed.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Chef Adam Jones, rated two stars by Michelin for the culinary marvels served at his old Parisian restaurant, might know his business in the kitchen. But a past drug and alcohol addiction has left him burned. Now in London, he wants to start anew in partnership with an old associate, Tony (Bruhl). After gathering a new team of kitchen expert friends, his aim is now three Michelin stars. But along the way, he must overcome his own personal demons.<br>
<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> For a film that's about the food that a kickass chef is able to dish out, you might wish that there was more about the actual grub. Like, maybe a special dish. Ratatouille was all about that dish. Chef made you salivate. Sure, there are shots of sole being filleted, scallops being diced, shallots caramelizing in a pan, garlic mashed potatoes being whisked and filet mignon steaks browning on a hot plate while being sauced over. But Wells' Burnt puts the focus on Jones (Cooper) and his tantrum-laden temperament that's apparently justified by the fact that he can cook better than anybody. His preparations are painstakingly precise (a la Heston Blumenthal) and he aims for nothing short of perfection.<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> If you saw PA 4 and were either disappointed or underwhelmed, this one too is nowhere close to the smorgasbord of scares that the first one in the series - produced, written, edited, directed and shot (in his own house too) by Oren Peli - served up. Older films in this franchise seemed like a recombination of the same set of past ingredients.<br>

<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The celluloid rendering of RL Stine’s Goosebumps is a delightful feat. Despite coming a decade too late, director Rob Letterman ensures that this comic horror film is a hoot all the way. For young,? voracious readers, Stine’s series was a way of life before JK Rowling’s Harry Potter books took on the mantle to add some magic to our lives.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Richie Lanz (Murray) is a down-on-his-luck manager of musicians. While claiming to have once had a glowing roster of stars, the best he can now do is to book his sole act, Ronnie (Deschanel) to sing in dive bars. His life changes one day, when he ends up in Afghanistan, discovers a talented Pashtun singer named Salima (Lubany), and has her participate in reality show Afghan Star.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Richie runs his artiste management business from a makeshift office in a Van Nuys motel. A hustler at heart and in desperate need of cash, he’ll manage even the worst possible singers who are tone deaf, in a desperate bid to cover his costs. Ronnie helps him out as his secretary in the hope that he’ll steer her in the right direction, career-wise. So when a promoter asks him to get Ronnie to tour Afghanistan, Lanz’s sold on the idea.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>In days of old, when magic filled the air, a battle took place between witch hunters and witches. During that battle, a hunter named Kaulder (Diesel) was ‘cursed’ with eternal mortality by the Witch Queen. In the present day, the threat of witches has not vanished, and he finds himself on a mission to destroy the Witch Queen (Engelbrecht) who is bent on wiping out humanity.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> In the modern world, witches are allowed to go about their business on one condition – that they do not harm humans. Kaulder has been hunting witches for centuries – 800 years, as he keeps reminding us – and is aided by his wise priest partner, Dolan the 36th (Caine). The two could not have made an odder pair. The sagely Dolan speaks with a quiet confidence, dishing out advice and witticisms to Kaulder.<br>

A turn of events leads her across the Atlantic to Cumbria, England, where she finds herself in a mansion that almost lives and breathes, replete with hoary horrors and sinister secrets.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> What is immediately striking about this movie is the immaculate camerawork, framing and detailing. For example, when tea is stirred in an antique china cup, you hear the faint rasp and tinkle of silver spoon against porcelain. The crunch of leather hobnail boots on virgin snow is audible. An ancient bedroom door, when cautiously opened, emanates a symphony of creepy creaks. And when Edith holds aloft a candelabrum to help illuminate her path through dark, corroded corridors, you can almost hear the flames burning away on the fat candles.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Peter Pan was never a superhero but his flying quirks and his affability has endured the years. Joe Wright's origin-story film Pan based on JM Barrie's Peter Pan (as the film's end credits spell out) banks solely on the innocence of its child actor, Miller. The film is strictly for kids and probably that's how Wright had planned it.<br>

She had also stumbled upon a rather unsettling discovery inside the house they were raiding. Macer then volunteers to be part of a strike group whose mission is to take down a drug cartel.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Be it the fact that this film deals with modern-day drug wars along the US-Mexico border, or the movie’s ominous tone, you might find yourself reminded about both Steven Soderbergh’s Traffic (that also starred Del Toro) and – also directed by Villeneuve – Prisoners at various points during the movie. The former for the content (drug wars) and the latter, for the pacing and immersion. But that’s where any semblance of common ground ends.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>The Walk derives direct inspiration from the daring high wire walk that Frenchman Philippe Petit successfully undertook from one of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center to the other, on August 7, 1974.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> There are plenty of reasons as to why you could watch this film. For one, the climax of the movie – the high wire act itself that is a culmination of all the meticulous planning that preceded it – is worth the ticket price alone. You will find yourself gripping the armrests, anxiously hoping that Philippe Petit’s (Gordon-Levitt) act doesn’t end up in tragedy. And on the other hand, the film might prove to be a little nerve-wracking if vertigo means more to you than an Alfred Hitchcock movie name!<br>

<strong>Movie Review: </strong>2014’s The Maze Runner ended on a thunderous note with a State agency assuming the responsibility of eradicating the homicidal virus which transforms people into zombies. In this edition, the story picks up from there and unravels the survival journey of a bunch of kids after they escape from the underground paramilitary accommodation where they were put up after being rescued. A large part of the narrative is devoted to keeping the element of mystery consistent.<br>

<br>
<strong>Movie Review:</strong> The characters that inhabit a Nancy Meyers (Something’s Gotta Give, The Holiday, What Women Want etc) film are usually fairly well-off and seemingly, don’t have much to worry about except for maybe, their love lives. For Meyers, it’s the kind of tried-and-tested confection that plays it safe and sweet.<br>
Therefore, if not for De Niro’s presence here, this movie would have been just another by-the-numbers flick about millennials and their various issues. Sure, Anne Hathaway does essay her somewhat conflicted character as the fast-paced (she rides a cycle in the office and personally takes random customer calls) startup owner who juggles a family life too, quite well but it is not something that any other actress in her league could not have done equally well, if not better.<br>
