"<div class='Normal'>Okay. Let's assuage your curiosity at the onset. Here's the answer to your million dollar question: No! apni Aishwarya doesn't disappear from the screen when you blink your eyes. Ever since her presence in Pink Panther was announced, the grapevine has been bustling with queries about the length and breadth of her role, with sceptics predicting a mere cosmetic presence. Remember Mallika Sherawat in Jackie Chan's The Myth?<br>
<br>
Well, Ash may not have much to say in this Steve Martin show, other than stock lines. And, she may have spent most of her time as a svelte, also-starring, member of the Clouseau gang. But she plays a role that's of a completely different hue from her popular Bollywood avtars. Reason enough for the desi film buff to celebrate our desi girl's cross over. But of course, we, being the argumentative Indians, do have a niggling query...How come, most of the men have their hormones shooting up for the sober Nicole (Emily Mortimer), when actually, there ain't nobody like our desi girl? Strangely, nobody has the hots for Ash and both Andy Garcia and Steve Martin seem to go in a tizzy whenever the dumb, drab blonde's around. Ekdum hard to digest.<br>
<br>
The film's a light and breezy comedy which you can definitely enjoy, if you stop looking for Peter Sellers in Steve Martin. Martin's Inspector Clouseau is a bumbling, bright old fella who bites the dust, whenever he is supposed to stand tall and vice versa. Elevated from his punishment posting as a traffic cop to the elite dream team set up to nab The Tornado, the new thief round the block, he sets out on a goofball mission that sees him doing the silliest things, with French panache. The Tornado has already stolen the Magna Carter, the sword of the Japanese Emperor and now wants to steal the famed diamond, The Pink Panther, which is a symbol of French honour. The international team of detectives, comprising stalwarts like Andy Garcia, Alfred Molina, Jean Reno, Aishwarya Rai, sets out on a roller coaster ride of upmanship.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, it's affable old Clouseau who steals the show, with his antics, which include a hilarious rip-off as the Pope. And yes, his love-hate relationship with Chief Inspector Dreyfuss (John Cleese) literally sets the guns blaring. Don't expect a monumental performance by Aishwarya, and you'll find this sequel a pleasant viewing.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>History records there were 15 assassination attempts on Hitler, and all of them were futile. For, the world's most controversial head of state actually committed suicide, nine months after a bombing attempt on him boomeranged. Valkyrie is a nail-biting historical thriller on this foiled assassination bid which might have changed the course of history if it had succeeded on July 20, 1944, when a bomb went off during Hitler's official briefing, causing just superficial burns to Der Fuehrer. The botched up attempt was followed by a series of arrests (700) and executions (200), even as Hitler's grandiose dreams of world domination were turning into a nightmare.<br>
<br>
But Valkyrie isn't about the vengeance that followed; it is more about the man who might have ended up as history's biggest hero: Colonel Von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) who didn't mind being guilty of high treason, as long as he could save his country from ill-repute and disdain. With an eye patch and a disabled hand, Stauffenberg turns out to be the only unscarred German who managed to build a team of righteous men, ready to rid their country of the dictator with a dubious human rights' record. Stauffenberg not only manages to carry the bomb and place it right under Hitler's nose, he chalks out a meticulous military coup too and almost sets up a parallel government, after the explosion that might have blown an ordinary mortal into smithereens. But Hitler was destiny's child, or so it seemed. For even as Stauffenberg's men go about arresting the guilty Nazis, the radio sends out Hitler's broadcasts....<br>
<br>
Bryan Singer has always been a skilful storyteller with a handle on the thriller noir. Remember Usual Suspects? Well, Valkyrie may not have the unpredictable twists that made Usual Suspects an Oscar winner, nevertheless, it does keep the adrenalin pumping, as you keep pace with this historical thriller that draws much of its appeal from the fact that it happened in the cataclysmic 1940s, where one aberration might have altered the course of world events. While Hitler largely figures as a silhouette in the film, it is Tom Cruise who remains with you as the tormented military man with a conscience that precluded him from raising his hand to `Hail Hitler!', the ubiquitous Nazi salute.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Brokeback Mountain may have come and gone, winning Oscars for its gay heroes and it's paean to sexual liberty. Just as 30 years may have passed since the assassination of gay activist, Harvey Milk. But the story of equality remains almost where it was, the world over. Homosexuality still isn't accepted as easily as heterosexuality and the closet is still tumbling out with `me too' stories of alternate sexual preferences.<br>
<br>
Hence the importance of a biopic on Harvey Milk (Sean Penn), the first openly gay man who ran for public office in San Fransisco in the 1970s and ended up being elected as supervisor, after 3 failed attempts. From a champion of gay rights in a homophobic society, Milk metamorphosed into a human rights activist and became a national hero in his short life span which became a beacon of hope for any and every marginalised soul. And why not? Specially since there was a single credo behind every campaign that Milk initiated. He simply believed: All men are created equal. No matter how hard you tried, that could never be erased.<br>
<br>
The film follows Milk's transformation from a carefree hippie who moves from New York to San Fransisco with his companion (James Franco), sets up a camera shop in the working class neighbourhood and decides to do something meaningful with his drifter's life. As a public officer, he campaigns for a gay rights' ordinance and unleashes a fiery fight against a ruling that empowers the government to sack people on the basis of their sexual preferences. This brings him in conflict with Dan White (Josh Brolin) a conservative Christian and a seemingly straight member of the Board of supervisors, who cannot accept this `ungodly' (that's what he believes) behavioural code. This is the beginning of a fateful relationship which culminates in a tumultuous climax.<br>
<br>
Watch it for an unforgettable performance by Sean Penn who is heroic in his ordinariness, proving that outliers and high-flyers are made, not born.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Farah Khan and Zoya Akhtar aren't alone in going behind the silver curtain and uncovering the grime that lies beneath the glamour of tinsel town. Barry Levinson, the director who brought us the delectable political satire, Wag the Dog, now tries to give us a dekko at what lies out there in the chaos-ridden, cruel studios of Hollywood.<br>
<br>
Based on the memoirs of Hollywood producer, Art Linson, the film traces the high drama that takes over the life of fading filmmaker, Ben (Robert DeNiro), as he tries to survive in a cut-throat industry that is forever on `delete' mode. On the one hand, Ben has a terrible film in the cans which faces the scissors at the studio screening itself. The film, which features Sean Penn in the lead, has a controversial climax of a dog being shot in the head. Reason enough for the studio heads to put it on hold. On the other hand, his new venture can't begin because the new hero, Bruce Willis has grown a beard and a bulging middle. Add to this, is Ben's still lingering passion for ex-wife, Robin Wright Penn, which makes the separation-therapy he's undergoing absolutely ineffective.<br>
<br>
Recipe enough for loads of drama that keeps the entertainment meter alive and kicking. But not really something you'd expect from Raging Bull, Robert DeNiro..<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Based on the self-help book written by Greg Berhendt and Liz Tuccillo, the film is a string of stories, loosely interwoven, with just one intention. They propose to tell you when a guy is interested in you and when is he trying to avoid you. How profound! Now, when did we need a book to unravel the mysteries of the heart. If only relationships could be worked out by flipping pages of a bestseller.<br>
<br>
Forget the lament. The stories are actually light and easy viewing, although they might have crackled with a bit of comedy in them. The only funny story that makes you laugh is the desperate man hunt by a dotty Ginnifer Goodwin who spends most of her time staring at her phone, almost willing it to ring. She's waiting for the guy she met last night to call her back for another date, maybe tonight. Of course, no one calls back and Ginnifer wonders whether she's the exception or the rule when it comes to love fulfilled.<br>
<br>
The other confused in-love, out-of-love Baltimore girls include Jennifer Aniston who's wondering why Ben Affleck doesn't propose marriage, despite living with her for seven long years; Jennifer Connelly who is willing to forgive her husband a one-night stand, but can't handle his covert smoking; Scarlett Johansson who falls in love with a married man who feels too guilty after succumbing to her charms. And finally, there's Drew Barrymore who finds mates easily on MySpace but can't seem to attract anyone in real life.<br>

This one's sheer candy floss, meant for a Valentine viewing. Don't go looking for heart-tugging romance and you won't end up disappointed.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>Will Smith is determined to swing both ways, in terms of artistic exploration. If, on the one hand he wants to give his viewers an adrenalin high with films like Men in Black, I Legend and Hancock, he also wants them to remember him as a high performer with soul-stirring acts like The Pursuit of Happiness and now, Seven Pounds.<br>
<br>
Ben Thomas (Will Smith) is the most unusual tax man in town. Unlike the sharks in the IRS, this sad man with soulful eyes goes looking for deserving people who should be given a tax break. Some tax man! Living all by himself in a fleabag motel, with a jelly fish for company, he hunts all day for suitable men and women who deserve a favour. And finds them in the usual places: in hospitals, bars and broken homes, where the almost dead and the hopeless wait for sordid ends. Forlorn Ben not only befriends them, he even finds a solution to their problems and ends up like the friendly neighbourhood Spiderman, albeit without the web and the flying fetish.<br>
<br>
And in the course of playing Good Samaritan, he manages to find love too, with beautiful, lonely Rosario Dawson who will die in a few months, if her pager doesn't ring. She has a congenital heart problem and the hospital has promised to page her if they find a donor. But love too turns out to be forbidden for angst-ridden Ben who desperately tries to turn his back to a second chance, only because it's redemption rather than romance that our hero is scouting for.<br>
<br>
So, is he doomed to rest content with a single night of passion that follows a romantic candle-lit dinner or can the music play on, past the morning too? Seven Pounds is a sincerely told, mushy tale about spreading good cheer and making the world a better place, with Smith essaying the role of the tormented do-gooder with impeccable zeal.<br>

He's actually the counsellor who keeps the family together through their sundry ups and downs, which are actually part and parcel of every young couple's life.<br>
<br>
John (Owen Wilson) and Jenny (Jennifer Aniston) are two ambitious, young journalists in South Florida who adopt Marley, before they start their family. It doesn't take long for them to recognise their dog's destructive tendencies and they brand him the `lovable' hound from hell. For Marley eats up everything, including the answering machine and a diamond necklace and transforms their house into a messed up, much lived-in home. Soon, the couple undergo the usual trauma of parenthood, with both having to compromise on their careers for the sake of their family and the relationship enters rough weather. But there's Marley, remember: the only constant in their changing lives. He's there when the babies cry the night through with colic. He's there when Jenny needs some comfort and care while tending to her brood. And he's there with John on the seaside, listening man-to-man, as his master pours out his angst to him.<br>
<br>
So what's the glue that keeps the family together? Marley and his unconditional love for the Grogan family, which demands nothing from them, except their heart. This one's for a mushy, sentimental family viewing, with the doggoned tale of a man's best friend.<br>

Of course, it doesn't exactly get as inventive when lifting the veils on celebrity journalism as The Devil Wears Prada did with the fashion world, but the misadventures of Simon Pegg in Sharp magazine do have their malicious moments.<br>
<br>
Journalist Sidney Young, a news hound who gets the celeb gossip any which way, gets a chance to move uptown when a New York publisher (Jeff Bridges) offers him a job in Sharp, his popular hobnob-with-Hollywood magazine. Now, getting close to celebs in a megapolis isn't quite easy as it seems, specially when your hormones are on overboil whenever you come in close contact with starlets like Sophie Maes (Megan Fox) and their hard-as-nails publicists like Eleanor Johnson (Gillian Anderson).

All you can make out of this extra-terrestrial goop is orange eyes, a giant beetle's silhouette and some yucky saliva.<br>

They call him Moorwen. At least that's what the alien, Kanian (Jim Caviezel) who accompanied him to planet earth tells us. And Kanian would know, since Moorwen was a stowaway on his space ship, as it crash landed on terra firma during the Iron Age. While Moorwen flees into the neigbouring forests and begins to feast himself on the villagers, Kainan is held captive by the Vikings who mistake him for the marauder. Doesn't take long before the Viking king realises he is actually their saviour and encourages his feisty daughter (Sophia Myles) to have a bit of fun on the side, since she's already betrothed to another Viking warrior (Jack Huston).<br>

"<div class='Normal'>America may have its first black president, but there are still a lot of stories left to be told about racism and the rise of black power in the US. Honeydripper is one such sensitive tale of self-esteem and survival in Alabama during the 1950s, when most black people were supposed to pick cotton on the white man's farm.<br>
<br>
Entrepreneurship was obviously neither meant nor expected from them. Hence, the importance of Danny Glover who tries to run a small pub, despite the hostile environs around him.<br>
<br>
Honeydripper is Glover's little beer joint which has hit upon bad days and is fast losing out on business. The harried man has just a few days to clear his debts or else he loses his eatery, which once was the most popular jazz joint in the neighbourhood.<br>
<br>
He sacks his old jazz singer and decides to bring on a popular city guitarist to rev up the music and bring in the customers. But the guitarist fails to turn up and Glover thinks it's time to pull down the shutters when his step daughter reminds him of Sunny (Gary Clark Jr), the guitar-toting vagabond they had fed once. Sunny and his strange new guitar (read electric) not only mark a new beginning for Glover's business, they also usher in the age of rock 'n roll in this small hamlet that's trying to keep pace with the march of history.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>There was a Kill Bill and there is a dead Bill. Of course, there are no similarities between this deadpan comedy about Bill's search for identity and Quentin Tarantino's high octane action film, other than the title.<br>
<br>
But titles can be terribly misleading, as can the cast. The filmmakers commit harakiri by reducing Jessica Alba to a mere tag-along-girl who steps in when Eckhart's wife (Elizabeth Banks) is busy with a bit on the side. And when Alba's not playing proxy, she's playing crosswords with a precocious little school boy. Simply not done.<br>
<br>
Middle-aged Bill (Aaron Eckhart) is on the cross roads of his life. His job sucks, his wife's cheating on him and his midriff's swelling. The only thing he digs are doughnuts, which obviously aren't good for him.<br>
<br>
And adding to his litany of woes is this new mentor programme, where he is saddled with a teen schoolboy who thinks life is fun, just fun. It doesn't take long for Bill to realise the boy's actually right and soon he's ready for a physical and mental make-over after shedding the gangrene off his life.<br>
<br>
So, who's mentoring whom? Camp fires, crackers, pyjama parties coupled with some hardballed fisticuffs is all it takes to make befuddled Bill come of age. Only, the fun parts seem to elude the viewer completely in this meandering, plotless venture.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>He's the archetypal Mr Under-Appreciated by now. For Adam Sandler has never really digressed from his first few roles of the affable underdog that made him a household name, some years ago. And like all 70 mm underdogs, Sandler too is a topdog in disguise. It doesn't take long for our bumbling hero to walk away with the Ferrari and the fair maiden, just like all those perfect Prince Charmings in the fairy tales. So how can it be any different with Bedtime Stories, where Sandler is actually supposed to tell happily-ever-after stories to two young kids. The metaphor must live on....<br>
<br>
Loser Sandler ends up as a handyman in the hotel his father built, simply because he isn't smart, urbane, yuppie, cocky. Or better still, he isn't Mr Butt Kisser, like his rival, Kendall (Guy Pearce) who not only plans to walk away with the top job, but also with the hot girl, who happens to be the owner's Paris Hilton-ish daughter.<br>
<br>
Having been bred on his father's bedtime stories, Sandler still believes fairy tales don't have sad endings. This belief is reiterated by his young nephew and niece, when he babysits them for a few nights, while their mom (Courtney Cox) goes job hunting. The kids always find a happy ending for his sad bedtime stories which always feature him as the loser hero, dreaming to grow from handyman to hotel incharge.<br>
<br>
Time for the magic to begin. One by one, the stories begin to turn true. It actually rains gumballs in drab real life, the fair maiden almost kisses him, the Ferrari seems to be round the corner and the zero is all set to metamorphose into a hero.<br>
<br>
This may not quite be the best from sad sack Sandler's gag bag, nevertheless, there's enough gooey stuff to keep the sweetness flowing. The film has some zany moments when Sandler's strange bedtime stories are actually translated on screen, complete with mermaids, monsters, gladiators, robots and space wars. But the essence lies in the emotional core, where Sandler tries to prove to the kids that he isn't the bad guy. He's the hero!This one's good timepass family fare.<br>

And he takes them through the usual ups and downs that we have witnessed so many times in the best and the worst of Bollywood masala: the tenements, the riots, the underworld, the brothels, the streets, the gutters, the stations, the separations, the reunions, the friendships, the rivalry, love, longing, despair...followed by final victory. And this heartwarming stayin' alive saga unfolds dramatically against the backdrop of Mumbai's underbelly, which stands by as a throbbing witness to the coming-of-age of its three protagonists, the three musketeers, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), Salim Malik (Madhur Mittal) and Latika (Frieda Pinto).<br>

Dylan himself strikes the note of the film when he confesses in a smoke-laden moment of introspection: ``I accept chaos. I don't know whether it accepts me.'' And the chaos theory prevails as you try and keep pace with the sundry versions of the singer played by different artists.<br>

The story begins with a boy Bob Dylan who calls himself Woody Guthrie and already displays the trappings of the vagabond sage who learns his first lesson from a kind old woman. She tells him to sing about his times. And times, they are a 'changing. So there you have Dylan, protesting against everything that's wrong in society and politics.<br>

<br>
The problem begins when the cops claim to have solved the mystery and deposit another little boy in Jolie's care, even though she insists he's not her son. When her protests get too loud, they put her in a mental institution for her share of the One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest crunch.<br>

Running parallel is another track of a psychopath who seems to have a fondness for axing kids in a chicken coop. Jolie's son may have been a victim too, but Jolie's fight isn't just that of a mourning mother. For her, it's a larger cause, where justice must prevail for all her newfound friends: the women who have been incarcerated in mental homes due to police brutality.<br>
<br>
Jolie may have lost out on the Golden Globe for her wide and wet-eyed portrayal of the crusading mother, but the Oscar buzz still remains. The film has been directed as a detailed period piece about an age when no one thought of photographic evidence or DNA testing. Yet, despite its gritty overtones, this one falls short of Eastwood's other highs, Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby.<br>

While George Bush himself is reduced to a bunch of raucous snores and a disembodied flick of the hand, India's famous Gen Xer's are themselves a bunch of nerds who think Colin Powell is Nelson Madela and Osama is Bhagwan Rajneesh.<br>
<br>
But in the end, despite their foibles, they are all lovable and recognizable, including the `communal' wannabe entrepreneur who ends up befriending the Muslim guard and applauding his Urdu poetry. Performance-wise, it's the uptight and complex-ridden Ms Konkona who walks away with laurels and laughs even as the film takes a healthy snigger at the desi self.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>BAZ Luhrmann is contemporary cinema's biggest, boldest maverick movie moghul. Having burst onto the world stage with Romeo and Juliet, his punkish adaptation of William Shakespeare, he brought back colour and melodrama to modern folklore with his stagey musical, Moulin Rouge. Australia, another magnum opus, is his ode to the pristine beauty of the continent down under, even as it creates a sweeping romance, with race as the leitmotif, reminiscent of Gone With The Wind.<br>
<br>
Set against the tumult of World War ll, the director shifts his drama to Australia, complete with it's characteristic slangs, lingo, cows, horses, farming, landscape, aborigines, celebrations, folktales, beer, the beef industry and above all, the dreams of the people who were affected by the fallout of history. And that's not all in Baz Luhrmann's Aussie continent. There's a good English First Lady, Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman), who sets out to seek her husband and then to fight for his cause. In due course bumping into kangaroos, native women who are easy to get along with 'only if you try' and the Aussie cowboy, Drover (Hugh Jackman) -- also the trusted man of the husband. What follows is a love affair, a battle between cattle barons, the bombing of Darwin Harbor and a lesson in aboriginal acceptance. In short, there's something for each one of you out there.<br>
<br>
Cut to the performances. Nicole Kidman lives up to her image of the original Oz in Hollywood, not just as the aristocrat who is quite a looker, but also as Mrs Boss for the neither-black-nor-white folks in town. Reasons enough to overlook her ignorance at horse riding, singing, story telling and playing mom. Jackman too is a delight as the rugged and handsome Drover whom, 'no man can hire and no man can fire'.<br>
<br>
But stealing the show as a surprise element is the aboriginal boy, Nullah (Brandon Walters), right from his love for the rainbow song to the little magic and his connection with King George. In fact, as a perfect narrator, he ties the first half (the cattle drive), the second half (the bombing of Darwin Harbor), the all-through love story of Sarah and the drover together. All this and more, till he best sums up Australia: 'When in Australia, do not look, but see!'<br>
<br>
Indeed, a film that any film buff would love to see! And savour.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>THIS one's for all those into graveyard shifts at BPO units: Before they teach you their accent, ask them to learn about India. At least, you won't have the typically amrikan queries coming your way. Try these: Why do Indians call Chicaaago Chicago? Why do Indians shake their heads each time they need to say a yes or no? Why do Indians worship the goddess of destruction? Why do Indian roads have cows all over? Why do Indians work when Americans sleep?<br>
<br>
Life's a relentless question mark for products salesman Todd Anderson (Josh Hamilton) when he is sent to India to train his replacement. And giving the desi, chatpata reply is none other than the intelligent and focussed Asha (Ayesha Dharker) who tells the world that India rocks because this is where kids do not walk out of homes when in their teens, we don't hate our jobs and we don't hate our bosses. But the real Indianism, that's incidentally nothing less than a desi englightenment for Mr Todd is our very own bura-na-mano holi hai festival. So, does he mind the colour riot? Not all all. After all, hitting gulal ain't no different than a baseball game. Truly incredible...<br>
<br>
And truly incredible is the power of Incredible India. How? Well, desi cliches no longer seem to be cliches. Todd doesn't mind being called Toad by the humble desi, dancing to Bollywood tunes becomes the ultimate experience for him, the first dip in the nearby pond is nothing less than nirvana, the goddess of destruction is there for him to 'destruct in order to start a new cycle of life'...<br>
<br>
Last but not the least, a special mention for Puro (Asif Basra), at the local call centre who does not mind getting riled provided his boss takes the right meal at the right time and the topical undercurrent of the BPO industry -- China is the new India with 20 heads worth the price of one. But the heart of the film comes from Todd's blossoming relationship with the Asha. This time for her cardamom body odour and third-eye-power (the shakti of the bhartiya nari that lies in her bindi), her mantra of do-no-touch-me-in-public-in-india, her faith in arranged marriages despite her dalliance with Mr America.<br>

It's actually a small, picturesque town in Belgium, but here it becomes a metaphor for purgatory, where three killers get a chance to choose hell or heaven. It's a smart gangster film, with some high powered acting by Colin Farrell as the conscience-stricken, suicidal hitman who has killed a small boy on his first assignment. Colin's manic energy is finely juxtaposed against Gleeson's cool kind-heartedness, despite the fact that he is the senior partner in this crime syndicate and has the most difficult mission at hand. And behind the odd duo is Ralph Fiennes, the boss who is a diehard family man apart from being a determined killer who comes down to Bruges to settle scores on his own when his hitman fail.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>FIVE months... Four weeks.... Three days... Two hours... One minute... Welcome to the grand finale of a tween reality dance show. A world that's full of dance and dazzle -- comprising jazz, waltz, balllets, auditions, semi-final and prop rounds. And loads of razzle that stem from the survival-of-the fittest syndrome, creative controversies, judges who feel 'there is no room for political correctness in dance', blackouts of kids with high anxiety levels... This one's a telling comment on the competitive new age peopled by pushy helicopter moms and their over-ambitious kids.<br>
<br>
First there is Justin Morgan who takes pride in daughter Tenille, who learnt German in three minutes, can dance like Mariah Carey, can sing under water and above all, can be forced to show her moves even as she trips and falls on stage. Second there's Paulette Gibson who claims her daughter Graci is 'an incredibly driven and competitive child'. As for the baba log, while Tenille's convinced that the judges get it all wrong each time she performs, Graci knows that 'mom always knows best.' All this revved up hungama happens in the high octane backdrop of Mr Jonathan and Ms Elizabeth's dance school.<br>
<br>
But what really keeps glittering in this razzle dazzle of reality shows is Darren Ashton’s own chicken curry for the soul. What’s that? No, not the young breed of accolade hunters who impress all with their moves. Or for that matter, Ben Miller’s performance, followed by that of Kerry Armstrong as a pushy stage mother -- indeed noteworthy. Well, it's the surprisingly mockumentary touch to the good 'ol Shakespearean funda with an emphasis on say-no-to-sexism -- All the world's just a competitive stage and all men and women are winners! And that's 'the new revolution of dance'!<br>

This three-letter word could just be your ticket for a rollercoster ride through life which could see you boarding a plane to Nebraska, for nothing at all, learning Korean, JLT, making-out in the middle of the road, minus all hang-ups, helping the homeless, sharing coffee with an unknown Iranian friend, hanging upside down from a bridge or even talking a man out of his suicidal mood. Of course, not forgetting grabbing a few promotions along the way, for your pro-active positivism at work or finding true love that's zany, crazy and completely unconventional.<br>

Jim Carrey may have sobered down somewhat, with his wrinkles and greys. But the funny man of Mask is still funny, minus the mask. As Carl, the bank officer, he pumps up the show, more with his middle-aged musings, than with the characteristic contortions of his facial muscles. A proverbial `NO' man, Carl undergoes a client empowerment programme which entails that he say `Yes' to every opportunity, if he really wants to hop aboard the success bandwagon. Difficult, but do-able, says the determined Carrey and begins to say yes to any and everything, however bizarre and improbable it may be.<br>
<br>
Truly, this is the magic mantra that has our hero hopping in and out of inconvenient situations, but always ending up a winner. He not only wins friends and influences people, he finds a funny girl (Zooey Deschanel of The Happening fame) too who also believes in the credo: normal is boring. She hurtles on a scooter, sings in a weird rock band, shoots pictures while running and teaches fitness to a bunch of loonies at the crack of dawn.<br>
<br>
It's a breezy, light-hearted film with some truly comic moments with Carrey displaying a newfound maturity. Catch him ending up as a terrorist suspect, simply because he took flying lessons and learnt Korean, and you'll know America is ready to laugh at itself, post 9/11.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>THE Film may be set in the battlefield of World War l, but it's message rings loud and clear, even today. For here, in the midst of death, destruction, war and violence, the armies of the feuding nations -- the Scott, the French, the Germans -- learn the most important lesson of history. One that declares, in unambiguous terms, that war is meaningless. Because humanity is one; there are no enemies in this overarching brotherhood of man. Supplant war with terror, and this multi-lingual film which has won applause at sundry international film festivals, becomes almost mandatory viewing.<br>
<br>
It's Christmas eve. The crusading armies decide to issue a temporary cease fire and crawl out of their trenches after they hear a famous German tenor set aside bullets and bloodshed and split the air with his soulful rendition of `Silent Night.' Soon, the German tenor and his mate (Diane Kruger), a guest on the front lines, are joined by the Scott and the French and the enmities are set aside for a combined mass, followed by football, champagne and loads of camaraderie. Soldiers who were brutally killing each other a short while ago are now sharing photographs of their loved ones and inviting each other for wine and song, once the war is over. Of course, nobody wants to ask the key question: how many of us will survive this needless violence?<br>
<br>
Christmas comes and goes. Ironically, the war doesn't. The hapless commanders of the respective armies are made to pay the price for their rationality in this season of hate, where young children sing songs of annihilation and priests send out the believers to kill the `vile OTHER', in the name of God.<br>

The film is a scorcher all the way.

The fire is rekindled when the duo get back together again in Bosnia, this time to capture a war criminal who seems to enjoying the patronage of the CIA.<br>

But that's just one part of the drama. The second, more interesting facet is the multi-layered plot which makes allusions to bin Laden and the abortive bids to nab him and to the horrors of ethnic strife that are tearing the world apart.

So what if this entails the annihilation of the entire human race! Earth, the only planet that can support complex life forms, must be saved from ecological apocalypse, any which way.<br>
<br>
The film is essentially a re-make of a 1951 film and traces the journey of an alien, Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) in New York, as he tries to evade the aggressive US forces, a shrewish secretary of defence (Kathy Bates) and an army of earthlings (scientists, cops, doctors) ready to capture him and put him in the petri dish, for research and experimentation. His only friend in this hostile territory seems to be doctor Connelly who understands Klaatu's concerns and begs him to help humans save themselves and their planet.<br>

Now the premise of the film does hold promise, but the execution is lack-lustre and minus all special effects. Now warranted at all, specially since sci-fi cinema has had a quantum leap since 1951, when the first version of the film was made. Dark, despairing, run-of-the-mill stuff.<br>

At least some of them manage to attain a certain degree of entertainment value, like Resident Evil, Hitman and now the most commercialised, dhoom-dhamaka Hollywood offering of the week based on a violent videogame — May Payne.<br>

Max Payne lives up to the video gaming formula and offers loads of action, drama, violence, albeit with characters that need no joystick to explode. The story also kowtows the plot of the game with Max Payne (Mark Wahlberg) being an NYPD cop who may be pushing files right now, but his insides are seething with revenge. He is hell bent on avenging the murder of his wife, baby and his best buddy. And that's exactly where his pain stems from. The outcome? He does not believe in 'heaven, but in pain, fear, death and angels'. No wonder he's all out Batmanish ishtyle against a major pharmaceutical outfit figure in the form of a winged demon (read Valkyrie) flying all over the NY city.<br>

Still waiting for a story? Impossible to understand if you haven't seen Casino Royale — you end up feeling somewhat cheated, as the secret agent sets off on some more run-ons, this time with a bronzed Olga Kurylenko as arm candy.<br>
<br>
From Italy to Austria, Britain, Haiti, Bolivia, an unsmiling renegade Bond, with a capture-or-kill tag on his head, tries to kills two birds with a stone. He tries to stop a shady organisation, headed by Mathieu Amalric, from buying off the water source of a Bolivian township and avenge the death of Vesper too. Arm candy, Olga too has her own scores to settle with the Bolivian general who is selling off his country's resources for personal gain.<br>

Craig's still balsy and beefcake; only a shade too embittered. The Bondettes, Olga and Gemma, are unimpressive, especially after Halle Berry had reinvented the Bond Girl with her feisty interpretation. Yet, despite the fire and brimstone, this hardly seems like a Bond film. Bring back the formula, please!<br>

"<div class='Normal'>DURING World War 11, there were a number of Algerian soldiers who fought for France against the Nazis. Till today, their contribution to the cause of liberty, fraternity, equality remains mostly unacknowledged and it was only after this film that the pensions of these soldiers which had been stopped midway was reportedly resumed.<br>
<br>
The film documents the heroism of these soldiers who may have fought shoulder to shoulder with the white men, but were denied equality. Not only were their rations and pay scale different, they were also denied promotions, despite their plea that bullets never differentiated amongst their targets in the battlefield. Their story of racism and indignity is primarily told through the experiences of four Algerian soldiers who stand up tall before the ravages of war and manage to hold on to a French town from the advancing Nazis, despite being low on ammunition and numbers. Completely denied their due, distanced from their families, the foursome continue to doggedly fight for a bunch of abstract principles...the only cause worth dying and living for.<br>

Gritty cinema; a great message: This is Saving Private Ryan with a whole new topicality attached to it, specially when the war against terror is being fought by multi-cultural, multi-national armies made up of natives and the white man.

<br>
The film traces a day in the life of Mrs Pettigrew (Frances McDormand), a woman who is hungry, friendless and minus a job as she walks through the streets of a city that is a strange contrast. On the one hand, London is quintessential Dicken's as it prepares for war and on the other, there is the gilded society that couldn't care less for the harsh realities of life. Our desperate woman seeks temporary refuge with a young singer (Amy Adams) who must practise time-management between her three suitors. More importantly, she must decide between the three and settle for love or career. Now that's not such a difficult task with the sensible Mrs Pettigrew around to tutor her.

It isn't difficult to read Hancock's true story. The world bashing of the super hero, who gets criticised for saving the world, is actually a parable for post 9/11 America. Think of the trail of destruction it left behind in Afghanistan, Iraq, even as it claimed to rid the world of terrorists; think of the ungrateful world which hurled abuses at it instead of saying ‘thank you' and you'll realise that like super hero Hancock, super power America too simply needs some good PR to set its image right.<br>

He offers to take him on as his client, gives him a shiny black super hero suit to work in, instead of his grubby overalls, convinces him to shave off his stubble with his nails, enter the scene of action through the door instead of breaking down walls, and more importantly, learn to say ‘Good Job!' to the beleagured cops who have been trying so hard before him.

The rest is all fun and games as Tom tries his best to sabotage his best friend's marriage plans, even though she wants him to be her maid of honor. The chemistry may be a bit tepid and the plot somewhat tardy and foregone, but there's enough for Dempsey fans to get dreamy about.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>LONG years ago, it was Holden Caulfield who was thrown out of an upmarket prep school to end up as an iconic teen hero in J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye. Seventeen-year-old Charlie Bartlett (Anton Yelchin) is a worthy heir to Caulfield's rebellious teen angst in this sassy and smart teen comedy that brings back the dysfunctional 1970s-1980s, when teenagers hadn't yet transmuted into the well-adjusted I-pod generation.<br>
<br>
Charlie (Anton Yelchin), a poor little rich kid, is thrown out of almost all the private schools, much to the discomfiture of his single mother (Hope Davis) who is forced to send him to the neighbourhood public school.<br>
<br>
Naturally, Charlie, in his shirt and tie, is a total misfit in the plebeaen environs and ends up bearing the brunt of the school bully on his first day at school. But Charlie is a survivor and soon ends up the most popular guy on campus, donning the cap of the in-house shrink who offers a pill for every solution. Having been prescribed Ritalin by his own shrink, he begins dispensing them to all his peers suffering from low esteem, heart-break, popularity craze....School's a rollercoaster ride, but for the perceptive principal (Robert Downey Jr) and his irresistible daughter (Kat Denning) who finds Charlie alluring too.<br>
<br>
Compelling performances by Robert Downey Jr and Anton Yelchin coupled with an undercurrent of comedy make this an interesting film that mirrors high school life with all its highs and lows.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>THE film has been hailed at the festival circuit and been toasted at Cannes too.<br>

And rightly so, for here's a whole new style -- and content -- for animation.<br>

It traces the attempt's of an Iranian woman to seek out her identity against the tumultuous history (1970 onwards) of her country.<br>
<br>
Marjane, the protagonist sees her country passing from one misrule to another, sometimes from the distance and sometimes from the midst of all the action itself.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>NOW this one's quite a funny spoof on the James Bond series, in league with Austin Powers' ass-brained mission to save the world.<br>
<br>
Maxwell Smart (Steve Carell) is the most unusual super agent who gets his chance to save the American President -- and the world -- from a nuke attack, on his first field assignment.<br>
<br>
Of course, he has his distractions in the form of his svelte partner, Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) who kicks butt and creates a storm with her super skills.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>ANG Lee's tryst with this lesser-known Marvel superhero didn't really scorch the screens a few years ago. This time, Eric Bana has been replaced by Edward Norton in the eponymous role and the film has been directed by a director known for his action films (Transporter 2). Does it work? Only slightly better, even though the director puts two giants in his film, good guy Hulk and bad guy Abomination.<br>
<br>
Norton's choice to play the title role is quite apt, because he's quite unnoticeable in his normal state. As a simple worker in a factory in Guatemala, he tries to find a cure for the gamma radiation that has altered his DNA. But before he can contact his online benefactor, the ruthless American general wants to capture him, replicate his blood group and create hundreds of Hulks who would serve as loyal American soldiers in all its sundry battlefields, the world over. Naturally, this is too much excitement for our superhero who can't even make love, in case his pumping adrenalin turns him into the green monster. So, with all those flying missiles and tanks, he simply turns mad.<br>
<br>
But Hulk is actually a hero and turns from fugitive to grand patriot, as he battles the other genetically-engineered product of the US army, the Abomination. All this action-hero stuff takes place, even his beloved (Liv Tyler) wants him to simply settle down as Bruce Banner, the inconsequential boyfriend who would have passed unnoticed through life.<br>
<br>
Enough action to keep the popcorn crackling, The Hulk has an added attraction: a guest appearance by Iron Man, basking in his newfound success.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>GREEN turns mean. Really mean. Yet, somehow, this Nature-Strikes-Back venture from Shyamalan may be a forceful plea to save the environment and keep your carbon footprint really small, it isn't great cinema. In fact, the chill quotient is so low that you almost wonder whether Shyamalan is actually a Hitchkockian heir. Although we would not like to write him off as a one-film wonder, we do confess there isn't anything -- neither the shock and awe factor nor the emotional quotient -- of The Sixth Sense in The Happening. You don't walk out looking tentatively at the trees nor skirting the bushes around you, even though the director has tried his best to invest them with a menacing life of their own. Not like when you began to take a second look at the friendly feathered forms after watching a DVD of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, a film which seems to have inspired this film.<br>
<br>
In terms of topicality, Shyamalan however scores. The film opens with a horrific morning in Central Park when New York is struck by a deadly virus that causes people to commit suicide. As soon as a mysterious breeze begins to blow, people in the park and the street begin to shoot themselves, workers jump off high rise buildings, zoo strollers put their hands and heads in the lion's mouth, glass shreds are used to slash wrists, ropes are meant for hanging.... Yes, no one's safe, not anywhere, for soon the virus spreads to the small towns as well and forces a science teacher (Mark Wahlberg) and his estranged wife (Zooey Deschanel) to join the mass exodus, with a father (John Leguizamo) and his eight-year-old daughter.<br>
<br>
It's basically a road movie, with the invisible killer virus chasing the bunch of hapless people who kill themselves gradually, while the nation looks for answers. Shyamalan offers no concrete answers, nor does he make you jump out of your seats. All he suggests is the possibility of nature wreaking its vengeance against a human race that has filled the air with toxins. The trees, bushes and grass have grown extra sensitive and are sending out strange emissions too. So much so, you have an almost demented scientist (Wahlberg) talking to a plant, only to find out it is plastic.<br>
<br>
Shyamalan tries to pitch an Al Gorian hypothesis in Hitchkockian style. But unfortunately, his open-ended film leaves too many questions unanswered and has too few twists to thrill the viewer.<br>

			Be Kind Rewind is the name of the rundown video store in a rundown neighbourhood in New Jersey. The store is soon to be pulled down to give way to a glitzy new condominium, much to the discomfiture of its owner Danny Glover who goes on a trip to find ways to salvage his shrinking business. While he's snooping around at the successful West Coast Video store, he leaves his shop to his assistant (Mos Def) who's best friend (Jack Black) ends up almost annihilating the store in his absence. Due to some quirky accident, the friend manages to erase all the tapes and the only way they can save the business is by re-shooting the films, their own way. They begin by creating their own version of Ghostbusters which ironically becomes a hit. Soon, the whole neighbourhood is queuing up for the indigenous versions of Hollywood blockbusters, which includes Robocop armed with a hair dryer.

			Funny, whimsical and warm, the film also raises the flag for the underdogs. And for indie cinema.

"<div class='Normal'>INDY is back and E.T. is angry. What more could you fantasy guzzlers ask for! Let your imagination run riot as giant ants hungrily gobble up humans, young Shia LaBeouf does a dazzling round of sword fencing with catwoman Cate Blanchett, while he is precariously balanced on two speeding jeeps, Harrison Ford lead his family through an ancient archeological maze, peopled with strange tribals, Karen Allen drive them down three never-ending rapids, without losing her hold on the steering wheel and the old lovers squabbling in the middle of a bog, with a rat snake to rescue them. And if that's not nail-biting stuff, then how about thirteen E.T.s staying back on Earth, teaching man the marvels of technology, building a fabled kingdom of gold, long, long ago...and finally losing their cool, when someone steals one of their crystal skulls and curious Cate -- a Russian agent -- wants to steal their knowledge. And hey, there are the emotional bits too that anchor the action in evergreen family kitsch. Like, Dad Indy and son Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) sharing milkshake in a cafe or racing on a mobike, right into the college library, while the Russians are gunning for them.<br>
<br>
It's a great comeback for the quintessential adventurer, Henry Jones Junior (Harrison Ford) who may be 65 years old, but he is still not willing to relinquish his characteristic hat to Henry Jones Junior 11. More importantly, he's still agile enough to save the archeological wonders that lie outside the arid classrooms where he teaches and even walks down the aisle with his old flame Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), while his son smiles down at him and combs his carefully cultivated puff with panache.<br>
<br>
Yes, style is the buzzword here, where the winning combination of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg recreate the splendour of the other three Indiana Jones films. Needless to say, Indy fans will always remember Raiders of the Lost Ark as their favourite in this quartet and will find the fourth a trifle slow. It does take some time for the adventure to warm up as Indiana Jones tries to outdo the evil Russians, headed by a deliciously malevolent Cate Blanchett, in finding the missing kingdom of gold founded by crystal-bodied aliens. Jones is helped by his wife, son and a senile professor who accompany him to the forbidden land in an adventure that combines Spielberg's two great passions: his love for larger-than-life special effects and his fascination for extra-terrestrials.<br>
<br>
Harrison Ford is like vintage wine, getting more heady as he greys and wrinkles ups. And along with young LaBeouf, he makes a winsome pair. Watch winsome LaBeouf turn up his nose at him and ask: how old are you anyway? Eighty-five? Then, watch our old man teach the kid lessons he can never pick up in school.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>IT'S a quirky road trip across the Indian heartland which presents colourful vignettes of a country which is being increasingly viewed as the perfect spa for soul therapy by the West. Director Wes Anderson captures the colours, smells and motifs of spiritual and mofussil India in this tale of three brothers who journey through India to discover themselves.<br>
<br>
Refreshingly, the style isn't as heavy as the theme may sound. For this sojourn of re-connecting with self and family is full of zany moments, which include an overdose of cough syrup, an attack of pepper spray, a tryst with a cobra, sex with the train stewardess, a sombre funeral attendance, replete with the colours and sounds of a camera that looks at India as the archetypal Exotic East.<br>
<br>
Owen Wilson invites his two brothers, Adrian Brody and Jason Schwartzman for a trip to India for two reasons. First he wants to find their mother (Angelica Huston) who had abandoned the family in America and disappeared into the Himalayas. And secondly, he wants the dysfunctional family to reconnect once again and heal the wounds that had been inflicted by time. The three brothers have their own sorrowful histories. While one is running away from fatherhood, the other is nursing a broken heart. They undertake the journey reluctantly, only to realise that this is one trip they would never like to end.<br>

Hey, didn't we say, east or west, India is the best! Jokes apart, this trip is recommended for its quirky quotient.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>IT grabs your eyeballs from the word Go and never lets go, till the final race is run, the victory lap is done, the family ties are strengthened and the spirit of freedom celebrated. Yes, Speed Racer is a film that breaks all the stereotypes, even though it dabbles with nothing but stereotypes. Based on a Japanese cartoon, the film blends all the popular elements of mainstream cinema -- action, family drama, David versus Goliath -- and produces a heady cocktail that literally makes your head turn. Not so much by the story -- you've seen it so many times, you already know all the twists and turns -- as much by its style. The Wachowski brothers have indeed created a whole new Matrix for cinema by replacing reality for a computer-generated, manga-like backdrop that looks straight out of an Andy Warhol painting. The colours are a giddy orange, yellow and purple; the landscape is psychedelic and surreal; the action is gravity-defying and jaw-dropping...<br>
<br>
And the drama? So very conventional. So very topical. The Racer family is the archetypal happy family which lives on love, fresh air and milk, despite the fact that it has a tradition of victory behind it. The Racer sons are natural born racers who have been hogging the headlines for long, while racing the home-made cars manufactured by Pops (John Goodman). Trouble begins when Rex Racer, the eldest son loses a race and supposedly dies in a crash. Speed (Emile Hirsch), the second son, now dons the mantle and begins winning again, much to the discomfiture of the automative magnate (Roger Allam) who wants to buy him up and become his sponsor. But for the fiercely independent -- and highly talented -- Racer family, the sponsor is viewed as the devil and Speed tries his best to win the Grand Prix all by himself, even though the Buy-it-all honcho insists all the races are fixed.<br>
<br>
While the family bonding scenes, specially the pep talk between Speed and Pops and Speed and Mom (Susan Sarandon) tug at your heart, it's the races that thrust you into playstation gear and get your adrenaline pumping. But more than all this, it is the structure and the anime form of the film which completely dazzles you. And the fact that all this tussle between big money and the basic spirit of the game happens in IPl season only makes the film extremely topical. Don't miss this post-modern pulp fiction.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>THERE'S got to be magic when two maestros meet. And there is. The Forbidden Kingdom creates moments of high action and fun when the champions of chopsucky, Jackie Chan and Jet Li, clash in this quaint oriental tale that takes you back to ancient China, when warriors ruled, monks fought and Monkey Kings metamorphosed into stone. And to ensure you don't lose yourself in this high testosterone time machine, there's our teen hero, an American kid who spends his time watching old Kung Fu videos from the local pawn shop, to keep you grounded.<br>

The drama is almost relentless, from the time the kid enters the pawn shop to discover the antique mast and listen to the mumbo-jumbo of the old Chinese shopkeeper. It's the mast that catapults him back in time, since it has to be returned to its rightful owner, the Monkey King. And the only two people who can help him reach his destination, an inhospitable place at a mountain top, is a drunken beggar (Jackie Chan) and a silent monk (Jet Li). Needless to say, the super duo is enough to stave off an entire army sent by the evil warrior who covets the mast and sends a delectable witch in hot pursuit.<br>

"<div class='Normal'>SO, yet motionless bodies moving our way and passionate kisses turning into chocking coughs? Now, haven't we seen that before? And with Shutter and its theme of spirit photography, we surely seem to have lost count. The film coughs up another vengeful ghost who tries to get her message across as many ghosts have done in the past. However, her ways are quite indirect and static. Not just atmosphere, the film lacks tension, wit and the much-needed scares. Even the storyline has another case of blurred images in bathroom mirrors, characters waking up from awful dreams, nothing new to offer. Newly wed wife joins her fashion shutterbug husband on his work tour to Japan, gets to see a whole lot of fashionably dressed semi-clad models, interacts with the who's who of fashion industry, till she finally discovers she's being followed by a ghost. And who helps her know that? Believe it or not, the husband's shutter, aka camera, that clicks pictures of the spirit under the table, on the bed, in the bathroom, on the roof, in the terrace, in the restaurant, at the wedding reception...

"<div class='Normal'>BASED on a Hong Kong horror film, The Eye comes a wee bit late. Because, Bollywood has already ripped it. Remember Naina, where Urmila Matondkar saw stuff - death, accidents, ghosts - after a cornea transplant. Replace Ms Matondkar with Jessica Alba and the soporific horror sequences of the B-grade Bollywood film with a handful of real chills and thrills and rest assured: this is an adequate time-pass film.<br>

Alba is Sydney Wells, the young, blind musician, who goes in for a cornea transplant, only to discover she was better off without sight. For her blurry vision shows her dead and dying people along with the shadowy, skeletal angels of death. More scary is the image she sees in the mirror in place of her face. It's a sad, doleful girl who seems to be telling her something. All that Alba has to do is to ferret that girl out and find out the disasters that lie in wait. And the only person who can help her is the reluctant doctor who drives her all the way to Mexico to meet her donor.<br>

He stops romping in the forest greens and takes a moment to listen. Is somebody out there, he yells. And gets a response too: from the Mayor of Whoville, a land where nothing goes wrong. It never has, it never will. Or so believe the happy-go-lucky Whovilles, until their world is threatened by the super-powered jungle folk, lead by the Lady Kangaroo who thinks Horton is lying. How can a speck of dust encapsulate a whole world, she chides the sensitive elephant and tries to devour the clover which holds the speck. It takes a lot of trumpeting and tail-pulling from Horton and his bunch of crusader friends to teach the arrogant kangaroo a lesson meant for all: Everyone's important, no matter how small.<br>

Nevertheless, you are willing to forgive the childlike simplicity of the director's attempts to dissect complicated conundrums like racial prejudice, communal bias, only because it states its message so very simply. The pithy film celebrates the spirit of tolerance, humaneness and empathy without going into heavy-handed dissertations on terror, Islam, jehad, backlash....<br>
<br>
The spirit of the film belongs to Anupam Kher who essays the role of a Sikh Colonel who heads a happy Hindustani family in Manhattan. Come 9/11 it isn't only the WTC Towers that end up as debris. The Colonel loses his son (Vikram Chatwal) in the terrorist attack and has no one to vent his anger on, other than Ali (Amit Sial), a young photographer who has befriended the family. Spending lonely hours in police stations and pubs, trying to find a rationale behind the gnawing sense of loss, he finds a soft target in the young Muslim and blames him for the violence that has scarred his life. Sense prevails when the turbaned Sikh himself becomes a victim of racial violence and it's time for building bridges once again; time for hope and a little sugar to sweeten up the soured affairs.<br>
