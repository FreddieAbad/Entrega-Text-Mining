"<div class='Normal'><strong>Spider-Man: Homecoming </strong><strong>Story :</strong> It's been a while since Captain America: Civil War, where an ecstatic and starstruck teen Spider-Man/Peter Parker (Tom Holland) rubbed shoulders with the mighty Avengers. Months later, Peter yearns for the heroic experience once again. But mentor Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) advises him to go back to school and patiently wait for his moment of glory, when he can assist the Avengers.<br>
<br>
<strong>Spider-Man: Homecoming </strong><strong>Review : </strong>However, patience is certainly not the boy’s virtue. Desperate to earn a sensational 'job offer' from Stark, the trainee masked crusader curbs petty robberies and scouts for a crime worthy enough to fight. He soon runs into ‘Vulture’ (Michael Keaton), a man who poses real threat to lives. Can Spider-boy take him down?<br>
<br>
Jon Watts starts his film with a clean slate. Unlike the previous outings, his Spider-Man reboot doesn’t necessarily have the aura of a superhero epic. He gives it a quirky campus-caper twist, which evokes mixed views initially. His Peter is solely focussed on being an A list (Avengers like) superhero. There are no sob stories of Uncle Ben or Aunt May either. May in fact, is a hottie (Marisa Tomei)! Once you warm up to Watts’ vision, this Spidey film, replete with humour and thrilling stunt scenes, grows on you and tugs at your heartstrings eventually.<br>
<br>
What also works is Holland’s effortless earnestness. The British actor is no looker unlike a Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield, nor does he carry their character’s emotional turmoil or bewilderment. But that makes him the most relatable Spider-Man, till date. You feel his need to prove himself to Stark; heartbreak, when that dream falters and him discovering himself at the end of it all.<br>
<br>
Other than Robert Downey’s recurring special appearances (even at an Indian wedding), it is Michael Keaton’s formidable screen presence as the anti-hero, that holds the film together, when Parker’s goofing around gets a tad tiresome.<br>
<br>
Spider-Man: Homecoming breathes new life into the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) as well as the friendly neighbourhood superhero that was forever torn between love and responsibility.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note: For those unfamiliar with Marvel films, remember to be ‘patient’ enough to wait back for two after-credits scenes.</strong>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>The Big Sick </strong><strong>Story:</strong> Kumail Nanjiani(Kumail Nanjiani) is a Pakistani cab driver and an aspiring comedian who is instantly drawn to American student Emily Gordon(Zoe Kazan) who he bumps into at a bar in Chicago. But, his parents want him to be a good Muslim and marry a Pakistani. And therein lies the conflict or at least some of it …<br>
<br>
<strong>The Big Sick </strong><strong>Review:</strong> Michael Showalter’s drama is based on the real-life romantic track of the protagonist (Kumail who plays himself) and the gori he ultimately marries. And the script (co-written by Kumail and Emily) has many laugh-out-loud moments. Their initial dates, where the couple talks of keeping it casual are fun to watch. As is the scene in which you’re introduced to Kumail’s family. The banter at Nanjianis’ suburban Chicago home with his parents Azmat (Anupam Kher) and Sharmeen (Zenobia Shroff), is delightful. Like most immigrants, they’ve made America their home, but Pakistan still resides in their hearts. Typically they encourage their son to pray to Allah and even organize a daily parade of eligible young Pakistani-American women for him to choose his bride from.<br>
<br>
Kumail who fears that he’ll be osctracised doesn’t tell his parents about his American girlfriend. Nor does he give in to Emily’s request of having dinner with her parents—Terry (Ray Romano) and Beth (Holly Hunter) who are visiting from North Carolina. This is when Emily decides to call off their relationship. But fate wills otherwise. When she lands up in hospital, Kumail who takes charge of the situation also comes to terms with how deeply he cares for her.<br>
<br>
Self-deprecatory humour keeps the mood alive through and through. Be it a mention of the ISIS or Terry’s wish to talk with a Muslim about the 9/11 attacks, everything provides a `good’ laugh.<br>
<br>
Kumail’s cowardice in not telling his parents that he is dating a non-Muslim and his initial terse interactions with Emily’s parents in the hospital are both funny and emotional.<br>
<br>
As far as performances go, Ray and Holly lead the way; Anupam Kher is adept and Kumail with his mostly-comic expressions passes muster. The film lacks the vitality of My Big Fat Greek Wedding and other such romcoms. It could also do with a 10-minute shorter run. But there is no taking away from the fact that this smart comedy is an ideal monsoon getaway.","3.5"

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Despicable Me 3 </strong><strong>Story:</strong> The third chapter in the life of Gru (Steve Carell), his adorable wide-eyed little girls and the minions, sees them embarking on a new adventure that involves a dancing villain Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), Gru’s blonde twin brother Dru (Carell) and a unicorn. Also, having given up his ‘villainy’, will Gru partake in a heist to keep his family tradition alive?<br>
<br>
<strong>Despicable Me 3 </strong><strong>Review:</strong> The latest instalment of Illumination’s hit franchise is the ‘Knight and Day’ and ‘Mission: Impossible’ of animation films. It has truckloads of action to keep you entertained and a bit of drama to evoke emotions. Fast-paced and loaded with adventure, this one rarely has a dull moment. On the flip side, you miss the heart-to-heart conversation between Gru and the girls that caught your fancy in the first film.<br>
<br>
To sum it up, this one's an outlandish and overstuffed sequel that has too many things going on all at once. It comprises a heist, Gru's discovery of his long lost twin brother Dru, bubble gum firing bad guy, minions displaying their singing skills etc. What it lacks emotionally, it tries to make up in the form of constant action sequences. While it’s not easy to make an exciting instalment with the same template, Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin manage it to a certain extent, thanks to Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig’s fantastic and consistent voice contribution.<br>
<br>
Though not as endearing as the first film or funny as the second, Despicable 3 achieves what it sets out to - entertain the kids. Unlike the previous films, this predominantly caters to the younger crowd. It lacks the warmth of the original but if you don’t mind too many Grus, guns, bubblegums and robots, this colourful, cutesy film can be a fun one time watch.<br>
<br>
<strong>TIP:</strong> This film doesn’t necessarily require a 3D viewing. 2D is just fine.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>All Eyez on Me </strong><strong>Story: </strong>An authorised biopic of the slain rapper Tupac Shakur leading from the time he got famous until his violent death.<br>
<br>
<strong>All Eyez on Me </strong><strong>Review:</strong> Saints and sinners, both have chinks in their armour. And when an ‘official’ biopic is made on these personalities, filmmakers often tend to deify them in the movie. That’s the case with All Eyez on Me; the official biopic of the slain rapper Tupac Shakur.<br>
<br>
The film paints Tupac (Demetrius Shipp Jr) as a saint of the ghetto with the soul of a poet who did nothing wrong. There is no question that Tupac was a genius, justly deified in the rap world because of his music. He fused together firepower delivery, a devil-may-care attitude along with a strong sense of social justice in his songs; something never seen in rap music before. He made around 700 songs and went multi-platinum on album sales before he was shot and murdered at 25. But he wasn’t all saint. It’s cringe-worthy then, when the film tries to portray him as one.<br>
<br>
Ambitious in the way it tries to tell the entire life story of Tupac, All Eyez on Me presents a bird’s-eye view of Tupac’s rise to fame and the key moments of his career. But it skips the moments which you want to see the method behind the rapper’s madness. The incident where a six-year-old kid is accidentally shot dead by a gun belonging to Tupac is glossed over. Even the gang connections he had in real life which often landed him in trouble, are not mentioned. The biopic shies away from his rough side that and only focusses on how Tupac was wronged by the society at large, and how his rise to fame, fuelled his demise.<br>
<br>
Performance wise, the film is rather weak. Demetrius Shipp Jr only looks like Tupac. There’s none of the craziness of the rapper in him which we’ve seen in Tupac’s interviews and his songs. Another huge disappointment is Jarrett Ellis as Snoop Dog, who lacks the nonchalance we see in the real snoop; he only sounds like him, which is comical. Dominic L. Santana as Suge Knight is more a club bouncer than a sharp record executive. And the entire Biggie vs Tupac rivalry is given very little attention.<br>
<br>
Since it’s Tupac, the music being brilliant is a no-brainer. However, unlike biopics on rappers in the past like ‘Straight Outta Compton’ or ‘8 Mile’, viewers who aren’t aware of the legacy of Tupac, won’t quite be able to connect with the film. But for fans of Tupac, it’s just the thrill of seeing something about their rap idol on screen. There are better unofficial documentaries on this subject. For those who believe in the controversy theory that Tupac still lives, this movie proves that he’s not among us anymore. Because if he was, this would have been a much better flick.

<br>
<strong>Cars 3 </strong><strong>Review: </strong>Pixar films have redefined the scope of animated movies with pathbreaking stories in the ‘Toy Story’ trilogy, ‘Wall-E’, ‘Inside Out’, ‘The Incredibles’ and ‘Up’, just to name a few. But few of their missteps have been as prominent as the ‘Cars’ franchise. With the novelty of the first entry wearing thin in the sequel, ‘Cars 2’ seemed like a blatant cash grab for the studio. That movie focused on a secondary character – Mater – for no reason, other than to ensure there was enough merchandise for kids to buy in stores.<br>

<strong>The Mummy </strong><strong>Review:</strong> Tom Cruise manages to stay fit at the age of 54 because he spends a lot of time running in his action movies. He also endures copious amounts of physical abuse, ranging from getting beaten up to thrown around; all for our viewing pleasure, while he gets a hefty paycheck in return. It's a fair trade for the most part - these are popcorn blockbusters that are mindless fun, and everyone is reasonably entertained. So it's hardly a shocker that Cruise ends up going through his tried and tested 'Mission Impossible' motions in ‘The Mummy’.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the entertainment value in this franchise-building reboot is thinly spread, leaving you feeling deprived if not cheated. This is a shoddy stab at merging action, mythology, horror and comedy resulting in conflicting tonality. Even the occasionally surprising, massive set pieces with elements flying at you in 3D, are interspersed between two-dimensional characters who exist merely to cater to movie tropes.<br>
<br>
Cruise’s protagonist is his version of a lovable rogue, in the same vein as Indiana Jones, making some seriously questionable decisions throughout the movie. Annabelle Wallis wanders around as the damsel-in-distress in need of constant rescuing. Russell Crowe hams it up as a Nick Fury-ish leader with ambiguous motives spewing campy exposition. There’s even the sidekick (Jack Johnson) whose weary sense of humour brings out eye-rolls, amongst even more exposition. If there’s one character your eyes will be glued to, it’s Sophia Boutella. Adequately mesmerising as Ahmanet a.k.a. the mummy, she transitions from a creepy, violent monster to a seductive goddess with ease, but her impact is reduced by the screen time devoted to convincing us of Cruise and Wallis’ love angle, even though that’s devoid of any chemistry.<br>
<br>
There’s enough gruesome eye candy, and in-your-face action to enjoy in ‘The Mummy’ if you ignore the plot holes and frustrating characters. But the first entry in Universal Pictures’ monster franchise comes across as a desperate attempt by the studio to capitalise on Hollywood’s current world-building frenzy. The amount of effort taken to construct the inevitable sequels is staggering. Admittedly, there's been some intrigue since we saw the heavily photoshopped picture of Cruise, Boutella and Crowe alongside Johnny Depp and Javier Bardem promising a lot more from the ‘Dark Universe’. But in the absence of quality writing, gripping plots and characters to truly care about, perhaps some monsters are best left buried.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story</strong>: Diana, princess of the Amazons, is raised on a sheltered island paradise and trained to be an unconquerable warrior. When an American pilot crashes on their shores and tells of a massive conflict raging in the outside world, Diana leaves her home, convinced she can stop the threat as she discovers her full powers as ‘Wonder Woman’.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: After decades of being lost in Hollywood developmental hell with a number of false starts and a host of A-list actresses slated to play the coveted role, this is the first bona fide, massive budget, female-led superhero movie to hit the big screen. By this definition itself, ‘Wonder Woman’ already had colossal expectations to meet, but with the added pressure of lifting the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) out of the murk of its dreary sub-par films, Gal Gadot had a lot of weight to carry on her shoulders. Fortunately, her first appearance in ‘Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice’ was well received, especially as Diana Prince a.k.a. Wonder Woman managed to stand her ground alongside two comic book behemoths. She continues to ride the wave in her own solo film, adding some much-needed confidence to the DCEU but more importantly doing justice (pun obviously intended) to the iconic female superhero.<br>
<br>
This is largely credited to director Patty Jenkins whose familiarity with constructing strong female characters, as seen in the Oscar-winning ‘Monster’, pays off here. Jenkins’ vision for this film is a blend of an uplifting and humorous outlook that has been sorely lacking in the DCEU till this point, infused with a strong sense of morale. Most importantly, it takes a distinctive stance on feminism – one that doesn’t resort to male bashing to get its point across, as highlighted in the relationship shared by Diana Prince and Steve Trevor, played by the charismatic Chris Pine. Diana is far from the damsel in distress in need of a knight in shining armour to rescue her, and Trevor is well aware of that. As a result, their connection is built out of mutual respect that plays very well on screen. Speaking of which, if there were any lingering questions about Gadot’s ability to embody the Amazon warrior princess, this film certainly erases them all beyond any shadow of a doubt. She is convincing as the naive yet steadfast fish-out-of-water, harking back to Christopher Reeve in the very first Superman film.<br>
<br>
But, the movie is hardly perfect – there are flaws in pacing and unevenly written secondary characters that resort to some stereotyping. Weak and shallow villains – the plague of superhero films – also infect ‘Wonder Woman’, and become a particularly sore point in the third act. These issues tend to take you out of the film’s experience and while they don’t negate the positives listed so far, lessen its potential to reach new heights as a great comic book movie. That said – this is undoubtedly the strongest DCEU outing till now, one that will add a new world of (female) fans to the franchise, and for all the right reasons.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Set in the early 1900s, ‘The Lost City of Z’ tells the story of Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) and his unexpected discovery – proof of an ancient South American civilization, in this biographical drama directed by James G.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Creating a biographical action-adventure drama understandably presents a lot of challenges, namely: staying true to the historical figure being depicted, and to the series of events in his life that make him distinctive enough for a biopic. Director James Gray chooses to tell Percy Fawcett’s story from his early days as a British officer, his interactions with the Royal Geographical Society, his voyages into the Amazon forest, his service during WWI – all interspersed between his personal life and the relationships with his family. At first, Percy’s motivations appear to be an attempt to ‘restore his family name’, gradually evolving into something much grander and altruistic. If this appears to be a lot to juggle between – you’re onto something.<br>
<br>
It’s not unusual for biopics to paint across the vast canvas of a person’s life, but James Gray could have benefitted by penning a tauter, leaner screenplay. The film feels stretched out at over two and a half hours, and wouldn’t be as hard to sit through if the lead character’s evolution was depicted with some charisma to elevate the protagonist's passion and motivation. Charlie Hunnam adds ample substance to Fawcett, but key elements of his persona - his drive, and curiosity to discover a new civilization, and the conflict faced by leaving his family behind on each journey, don’t come across as profoundly as intended. Hunnam is surrounded by a more versatile cast - Sienna Miller as his wife Nina and (surprise) Robert Pattinson as fellow explorer Henry Costin, each have moments that shine, although it is Tom Holland as his son Jack who adds more emotional weight towards the end.<br>
<br>
There are memorable moments even if the film fails to build on them to keep the momentum going, and to justify such a bloated runtime. Gorgeous cinematography and inspired performances are thrown off by clunky editing to make ‘The Lost City of Z’ an unbalanced, but fascinating watch.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Henry Turner and Carina Smyth are looking for the Trident of Poseidon. Jack Sparrow could also use it to defeat the evil half-dead man hunting him down for revenge. So they join hands and set sail…<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Time and tide wait for none. Not even for the likes of Johnny Depp and Javier Bardem, two supremely talented actors captaining this ambitious finale to the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise. As time runs out and tides become stronger, Bardem and Depp take turns at the wheel, and barely manage to bring the ship to shore.<br>
<br>
The movie has the makings of an epic adventure. The VFX is stunning, the actors’ comic timing is impeccable, cinematographer Paul Cameron’s sweeping shots of cramped Caribbean towns and the vast nothingness of sea are impressive, and the pace keeps you hooked.<br>
<br>
But Salazar’s Revenge is mainly held back by two common problems of the franchise. 1) The adventures lack the element of surprise; they’re more like road-trips with pre-determined pitstops now (a menacing villain, a curse here or there, a witch guiding the pirates, etc). And 2) The absolute irrelevance of Jack Sparrow to the main plot. Is there another movie that requires so little of its protagonist?<br>
<br>
Even in Salazar’s Revenge, Sparrow (Depp) continues to be a charming, drunken pirate who waddles into a quest for the ultimate treasure. Henry’s (Thwaites) quest, to be precise. As Henry tries to find Poseidon’s Trident and free his father (Orlando Bloom in a cameo) from a curse, he runs into Carina (Scodelario), who is also after the Trident as a means to connect with her own estranged father. But the young adventurers need a ship and a captain to take them to the treasure. And that’s the bare minimum Sparrow can do. Sparrow, in turn, is running away from Salazar (Bardem), a half-dead-half-alive ghost-man thirsty for revenge.<br>
<br>
The plot twists are too bizarre and yet not too unbelievable. The movie thrives on star-power, cameos and special effects. But the visual treat of a climax will pull the wool over your eyes, and you will buy into the fantasy.<br>
<br>
Go on this final voyage. The seas might get a bit rough but the pirates won’t rob you off a good time.

A small act of rebellion catapults her up the corporate ladder and she soon finds herself in the driver’s seat, navigating the company’s biggest, riskiest plans.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Circle </strong><strong>Review</strong>: Privacy in the Internet Age will soon be a sub-genre of thrillers. And as necessary as this conversation is, we’ve witnessed it onscreen before.<br>
<br>
From David Fincher’s morally ambiguous The Social Network to the recent Emma Roberts thriller, Nerve and from a slew of Facebook-themed horror movies (the if-you-unfriend-me-my-ghost-will-kill-you kind) to the HBO show Silicon Valley, we’re now familiar with the shady functioning of evil tech-billionaires and other disadvantages of going down the slippery slope of social networks.<br>
<br>
The Circle simply parrots these threats. It revolves around Mae (Emma Watson), the newest employee of The Circle, a one-stop shop that has overtaken all other social networks. Its bosses, Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks) and Tom Stenton (Patton Oswalt), have a unique vision for its future, and soon, Mae finds herself strapping on a camera and participating in their scheme to achieve “complete transparency.”<br>
<br>
<br>
The movie quickly turns into an all-star episode of Big Brother (Bigg Boss) and we see Mae sharing her life with the world. As she rises to Internet prominence, she starts losing hold of reality.<br>
<br>
That Mae will come to her senses and take her bosses down is as painfully obvious as the Facebook logo is blue. But the movie works purely as a cheap-thrills thriller in a lot of places where you just want to follow Mae and see her turning into an evil version of herself. A particularly interesting sequence has her colleagues giving her grief for not being on the social network, and it is at once familiar and sad. We’ve all joined the Snapchat we don’t understand and logged on to the Twitter we don’t have the vocabulary for due to peer pressure.<br>
<br>
Watson struggles with her grey character but is mostly believable; Hanks is smooth as a scheming social media mogul. Both actors try to infuse some humour and work with what they have.<br>
<br>
The Circle has the makings of a great thriller but just isn't well-rounded enough to leave a mark.","3"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Madeline suffers from a rare disease of the immune system that requires her to remain indoors at all times. But when Olly moves in next door, she realizes that there’s more to the world than the glass walls that restrict her.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Here’s the thing about cliche romantic gestures: you tend to buy them (no matter how many times you’ve seen them before), if attractive teenagers are selling them to you in a feel-good romcom setting.<br>
<br>
Everything, Everything has a bucketload of these cliches. It gives you a princess trapped in a glass (almost) castle. It gives you a wayward prince, who will rescue her. He will throw pebbles at her window, they will have their first kiss as fireworks go off in the background, they will be kept apart by the princess’s (evil) mother, and they will fight the world to be united. No surprises, no spoilers.<br>
<br>
Maddy (Amandla Stenberg) suffers from SCID, a rare disease that makes her immune system too weak to fight bacteria and infections. She has been cooped up in her house for 17 years and only wears white clothes. Enter Olly (Nick Robinson). He decidedly wears black, likes morose books and is kind of cynical owing to his dysfunctional family.<br>
<br>
Writer J. Mills Goodloe and director Stella Meghie spend a lot of time underlining how star-crossed Maddy and Olly are; how contradictory their lives have been. You don’t, for a second, question the fact that they’ll fall for each other.<br>
<br>
To be cliche and yet not get corny is very difficult, but the movie achieves this feat. You root for the characters instantly; the SCID barrier only adds charm to their awkward meetings - they’re lovers who can’t touch! It’s a smooth ride.<br>
<br>
Until one misguided turn drives the plot off a cliff. The seriousness of Maddy’s condition is moderated according to the need of the scene. The second half has a strong The Fault In Our Stars Deja Vu. And altogether too much time is spent on adventure sports in Hawaii. Go figure. A twist in the third act comes too late to save the movie from its highly predictable eventuality.<br>
<br>
Everything, Everything certainly isn’t what epic, heart-wrenching love stories are made of, but it’ll do as a date-movie that doesn’t demand everything of you.

<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Four years later, Ritesh Batra opens another lunchbox and serves up a story that is at once simple and magical, like a hot home-cooked meal.<br>
<br>
We know the key ingredient in Batra’s pantry: he spins the best tales out of regular people with insignificant lives and a slight irregularity that alters it all. In The Lunchbox (2013), it was misaddressed notes sent in tiffin boxes. In The Sense Of An Ending, it is a letter that forces the protagonist to rethink the course of his life.<br>
<br>
Tony (Jim Broadbent) learns that his ex-girlfriend Veronica’s (Charlotte Rampling) mother has left him a diary that belonged to his friend. But Veronica refuses to part with the diary. As Tony narrates old events to his ex-wife Margaret (Harriet Walter), he realizes that he may have a rather convenient memory of a murky past.<br>
<br>
Jim Broadbent plays a letter-writing grumpy old man trapped in a world of smartphones and clicks and clacks; the movie thrives on his comic timing and vulnerability. Charlotte Rampling is a force of nature even in this understated role that requires her to not say much. Broadbent and Rampling’s younger counterparts (Howle and Mavor) also add great charm to the movie. Harriet Walter is superb as Tony’s ex-wife who has little patience for his irresponsibility and his obsessive soul-searching.<br>
<br>
Writer Nick Payne has done a credible job of infusing this emotional story with a good dose of thrill; the last act is so structured that you may be left deciphering the plot if you don’t watch with rapt attention. On rare occasions, the movie delves into unnecessary details. Michelle Dockery plays Tony’s pregnant daughter and the purpose of her character isn’t entirely clear (except for a very obvious connection to an event in Tony’s past). But these are minuscule flaws.<br>
<br>
With his English-language debut, Batra proves that his journey as a filmmaker is in sharp contrast with the title of his film.

But he is forced to acknowledge his blue blood once he pulls the sword from the stone like Thor’s hammer, unleashing the evil in his uncle Vortigern (Jude Law). Can he reclaim his honour and lead the resistance<br>
<br>
<strong>King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (3D) Review: </strong>As expected, this is Arthur’s origin story and is reminiscent of The Lion King. While we often believe that the visuals of an Indian action/ adventure are not a patch on Hollywood films, the tables seem to have finally turned. We can now proudly say that Baahubali (belonging to the same genre) beats this film hollow, when it comes to its scale, grandeur, opulence, storytelling and even emotional quotient.<br>
<br>
Of course Guy Ritchie has a unique style and if you fancy his idea of cool, this erratic film revolving around the Arthurian legend is bound to engage you. Replete with Ritchie’s trademark fast to slow-mo action cuts, witty one-liners, exciting chase sequences, elaborate sets and a swashbuckling hero who is always two steps ahead of his enemies, this action adventure keeps you on tenterhooks.<br>
<br>
While Hunman makes for an impressive Guy Ritchie’s Arthur, it is Jude Law, who turns out to be a total stunner, making evil look sexy. He is cold, cruel and irresistible. After playing Watson with much élan, his collaboration with the Sherlock director in a much diverse role does wonders for them once again. Hunman is delightful too. Astrid Berges-Frisbey makes her presence felt and Eric Bana is likable as usual as the righteous king.<br>
<br>
What doesn’t work is a rather embarrassing guest appearance by David Beckham and Guy Ritchie himself. Also, the visual effects in 3D seem pretty messed up after a while.<br>
<br>
Despite the inconsistency in pace and vision behind this unique take on the legend of Arthur, Ritchie pulls it off in style. This may not be one of his best works but it entertains, nonetheless. Daniel Pemberton’s music deserves a special mention too.

<strong>Review:</strong> In 1979, when the opening title for ‘Alien’ slowly emerged on screen along with its instantly memorable theme, viewers had no clue what to expect. They eventually discovered what the vicious extra-terrestrial was capable of, and collective screams were heard loud and clear. Almost a decade later, an entire army of these creatures would wreak havoc in a sequel that ramped up the action and scares. Since then, the series has regrettably descended into generic drivel in an obvious attempt to capitalize on its popularity. Under the reins of Ridley Scott – who directed the very first film – ‘Prometheus’ showed some signs of a possible revival, harking back to the origins of the iconic space beast.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> In 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' the newfound team's adventures continue as they fight their way to unravel the mysteries of Peter Quill's true parentage.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> With the exception of ‘Captain America: The Winter Soldier’, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has notoriously struggled with their sequels. Be it Iron Man, Thor, or even The Avengers – none of the follow-ups managed to capture their predecessor’s magic. It’s not too surprising then that writer & director James Gunn tries to regurgitate the lightning–in-a-bottle success of the first film, by replicating some of the comedic elements that worked for it. Which isn’t entirely a bad thing – as this is arguably the most vibrant and whimsical comic book film we’ve seen in a while, and that’s precisely what it should be.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> When Smurfette stumbles upon the evil wizard Gargamel’s plan to find a secret Smurf village and destroy it, she embarks on a quest to warn the exotic inhabitants of the attack.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> The sworn enemy of the Smurfs, Gargamel creates the first female Smurf named Smurfette to try and gain access to the super-secret Smurf village. But Papa Smurf thwarts his efforts and does magic on Smurfette to get her over to the good side. While she looks like the Smurfs, she remains different than the others. Smurfs are supposed to specialise at one thing, (humour, baking, farming etc.), but she is a Jill-of-all-trades. On one ‘Smurfing’ trip, the evil Gargamel captures her and wheedles out information about another secret Smurf village. She breaks out of his prison, and struck by guilt, decides to go and warn the inhabitants of the other village with help from her friends Clumsy Smurf (Anton Yelchin), Brainy Smurf (Danny Pudi) and Hefty Smurf (Joe Manganiello).<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Unforgettable </strong><strong>Story: </strong>Julia moves in with her fiancé, David, but his ex-wife and her own haunting past join forces to rock her quiet suburban existence.<br>
<br>
<strong>Unforgettable </strong><strong>Review:</strong> Remember the sweet Katherine Heigl from romcoms like 27 Dresses and The Ugly Truth? Well, it looks like constantly looking for love took a toll on her. Here, she’s revamped her image and stepped into the shoes of a woman on the verge of madness.<br>
<br>
Tessa (Heigl) is the prim-and-proper American wife who wears pearls, speaks French and gives horse-riding lessons to her daughter. But her calm facade starts to crack when Julia (Dawson) enters her ex-husband David’s (Stults) life. Old demons start rearing their ugly heads and Tessa loses control. She targets the new woman, emotionally manipulates her own daughter, stages a fight to win her ex’s sympathy and even reconnects with Julia’s ex on Facebook.<br>
<br>
And while all of this is supposed to make you detest her, you end up feeling like she just isn’t trying hard enough! Being the supervillain in someone’s life surely requires more effort than badly constructed lies and amateur social media hacks. And this is where the movie loses you.<br>
<br>
Romantic thrillers about deranged exes are a dime a dozen and Unforgettable doesn’t have anything on the ones we’ve already seen. It looks like a half-hearted attempt at adapting The Hand That Rocks The Cradle and for a thriller, plays it too safe.<br>
<br>
The actors try to compensate for the predictability. Heigl is scary as the jilted ex with a stony disposition. Dawson plays a survivor of domestic violence and brings that vulnerability to her increasingly terrifying situation; a scene with her former lover is particularly impressive.<br>
<br>
But those are the only takeaways. We’ve seen crazier things done in the name of love on the big screen. Ultimately, it’s easier seeing Heigl pine for love than seeing her try to snatch it away from someone.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> The film is a poignant, true tale of survival that unfolded at the Warsaw Zoo during Germany’s invasion of Poland in the Second World War. Based on Diane Ackerman’s book, the wartime drama pays tribute to the heroic Polish couple - Jan and Antonina Zabinski, former Warsaw zookeeper and his wife. The daring duo saved hundreds of Jews by sheltering them in the basement of their dilapidated zoo right under the noses of the Nazis, who bombed the place, killed the animals and shifted a few valuable species to Germany. Against all odds, the Warsaw zoo was rebuilt and is open till date.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Sonata </strong><strong>Story:</strong> Three intelligent, self-sufficient women debate companionship, compromises and compassion over wine, cheese and (sour) grapes.<br>
<br>
<strong>Sonata </strong><strong>Review:</strong> You’d sooner see a flying saucer streak across the night sky than an Indian film with three 60-plus female protagonists who aren’t playing doting mothers, dying aunts or devious matchmakers. Kudos to Aparna Sen for pulling this lost demographic out of the shadows.<br>
<br>
In Sonata, a movie adaptation of Mahesh Elkunchwar’s play, Sen casually invites us into the lives of three women in the their sunset years.<br>
<br>
Aruna (Sen) is a linguistic scholar who won’t stand foul language; she’s comfortable living by the social code of a time whose scriptures she deciphers. While she’s in her prudish cocoon, her long-time friend and roommate Dolon (Azmi) is the butterfly that Aruna never quite morphed into. Dolon is the little devil on Aruna’s shoulder, always coaxing her into things that she’s uncomfortable with. The movie thrives on the nervous energy between Aruna and Dolon. The possibility of a subtle romantic subtext there is intriguing and handled smartly. Their third friend Subi (Dubey) flits in and out of their house and gives them something to think about with every visit.<br>
<br>
The movie has an unmissable Woody Allen influence, where the plot is merely a crutch to display well-rounded, vibrant characters. So while you cannot summarize the story, you can best describe it as an evening spent chatting with friends - you being the designated listener - where you are amused by Dolon’s indecision, Aruna’s meekness and Subi’s bouts with her men.<br>
<br>
And like all evenings with friends, there will be awkward silences when you will momentarily zone out when a character is droning about Beethoven, or an actor is delivering a heightened performance. In a play, this is charming. Sen hasn’t quite altered the screenplay or the treatment to fit this new medium. Static shots and indulgent conversations are Sonata's bane.<br>
<br>
However, it is rare for unapologetic narratives about older single women (who 'aren't even feminists!') to find their way to the screen. This is the kind of movie that you need to sip and savour. It won’t go well with popcorn and soda, but it’s worth a visit to the theatre anyway.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Aftermath </strong><strong>Story :</strong> A fatal plane crash changes the lives of Roman (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Jake (Scoot McNairy) forever. Roman loses his wife and daughter in the accident, while Jake, his mind as he happens to be the air traffic controller, who fails to avert the nightmare. Rage and revenge engulfs Roman and Jake finds himself swamped with guilt and regret. Can the two make peace with the past?<br>
<br>
<strong>Aftermath </strong><strong>Review : </strong>Director Elliott Lester tries his best to make this film (said to be inspired by true events) look like a psychological thriller. He even succeeds to a certain extent as there’s an air of melancholy, uncertainty and ambiguity throughout. Sadly, that’s not enough to hold your attention.<br>
<br>
Lester struggles to convert his compelling two-line story idea into a full-fledged feature film that strikes a chord with the audience. The wafer-thin plot runs out of steam and so does our patience, as we try to decode Roman and Jake’s behaviour and train of thought. While the execution lures you into closely observing and studying these two characters and their differing mind-set, the screenplay fails to move you beyond that. You don’t feel emotionally attached or invested in them.<br>
<br>
To make things worse, Schwarzenegger (who doubles up as a co-producer here) seems brazenly uninvolved. He sleepwalks through the role and contributes heavily in turning the film into a sleep-inducing drama, which rides on misery. McNairy however, is convincing and infuses life and soul into the otherwise drab and overstretched proceeding. But given the nature of the film, he alone cannot salvage this stagnant emotional fare.<br>
<br>
Aftermath, with its promising premise, could have been an intense drama but what you get instead is a wandering, forgettable story that reeks of nothingness.","2.5"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Fast & Furious 8 </strong><strong>Story:</strong> The eighth edition in the ‘Fast & Furious’ franchise (The Fate of the Furious) revolves around a mysterious hacker Cipher (Charlize Theron) who tries to seduce Dom (Vin Diesel) into the dangerous world of terrorism.<br>
<br>
<strong>Fast & Furious 8 </strong><strong>Review:</strong> Eight movies into 'Fast and Furious', one would think the testosterone-fueled concept of speeding cars that defy the laws of physics would begin to start losing steam. But Vin Diesel with Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, Jason Statham and crew manage to keep our eyes glued to the screen just for the sheer spectacle of complete mayhem that ensues.<br>
<br>
The franchise does try to do things a bit differently this time around. Since Dominic Toretto is virtually untouchable behind the wheel, turning him against his 'family' and leaving his crew to fend for themselves, considerably raises the stakes on a personal front. With the addition of versatile actress Charlize Theron to the mix as a hacker extraordinaire, Diesel even gets to flex some of his acting muscles. Though it's a shame that Theron doesn't trade blows with the boys, she's a heartless, cold and calculating villain who proves to be more than a challenge. The rest of the proceedings are standard alpha-male fare, though Jason Statham as Deckard and The Rock as Hobbs prefer to exchange a barrage of verbal insults at each other, saving their fists for other unfortunate souls. There’s a surprising cameo from a revered British actress who lights up the screen in the few scenes she’s in – clearly having fun in a movie that doesn’t demand more from her accomplished acting skills.<br>
<br>
There’s much to enjoy when cars are flying around the screen, even if logic takes flight with them. Some of the sequences are absolutely preposterous but make for such a dazzling display of destruction, they allow you to appreciate the sheer audacity of the filmmakers to even conjure them up! Traditional for big-budget films today, the plot leaves room for yet another outing, although at this point one wonders how much gas is left in the tank of this franchise.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Going In Style </strong><strong>Story: </strong>Given Hollywood’s current obsession with superhero and sci-fi thrillers, it's refreshing to see a simple tale of three elderly friends, willing to fight for their financial needs post retirement. Crushed under debt and with their pension being suspended, they must find a way to fend for themselves, even if it requires them to rob a bank!<br>
<br>
<strong>Going In Style </strong><strong>Review: </strong>You know a film has worked when you have a broad smile on your face; way after the film is over. A remake of the 1979 film by the same name, Zach Braff presents a pleasant cocktail of lifelong friendship; heist comedy and a social commentary on the condition of senior citizens, through his three affable lead characters – Joe (Michael Caine), Willie (Morgan Freeman) and his prickly musician roommate Albert (Alan Arkin) in this breezy dramedy.<br>
<br>
What makes an otherwise regular story unique is Braff’s execution. Despite touching upon real issues of the elderly, like financial crisis, illness or their anticipation of death, nowhere does the script get soppy or melancholic. It in fact leaves you grinning from ear to ear with its dark humour.<br>
<br>
'Wondering if the insipid corn they had on the buffet is from the World War II days', Alan Arkin exudes wicked sarcasm and fits the bill. The acting genius of these veteran stars needs no introduction but we must say, with such fine actors at the helm of things, there’s nothing that they can’t pull off.<br>
<br>
While the heist chaos is a bit juvenile, the film works for its self-deprecating humour and chemistry between its phenomenally talented actors. The clever writing does justice to their acting prowess.<br>
<br>
To cut a long story short, Going in Style is a warm and wonderful film on friendship and life post 60. Watch it with your best friends for life as some relationships are worth melting for indeed.","3.5"
"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Set in a futuristic world where humans are cyber-enhanced, Scarlett Johansson stars as Major – a soldier devoted to stopping the world's most dangerous criminals in this adaptation of the 1995 anime.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Going into this film, it’s impossible not to make comparisons to the original anime that went on to become a seminal work in science fiction. Visually and thematically rife with new concepts, the 1995 version was a ground-breaking animation that not only introduced the world to manga and anime, but also went on to inspire several blockbusters such as the ‘Matrix’ series, and ‘Avatar’, to name just a few. To say this Hollywood live-action remake had big shoes to fill would be a gross understatement. It didn’t help that the film was mired in controversy from the outset as a Caucasian actress (Scarlett Johansson) was chosen to depict Major, portrayed as a Japanese character in the original.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Colossal </strong><strong>Story: </strong>Used to being excused for her irresponsible drunk behaviour, Gloria (Anne Hathaway) is in for a rude shock when her live-in boyfriend Tim (Dan Stevens) throws her out of his posh Manhattan apartment, hoping she gets her act together. With no job or a relationship, she seeks refuge in her hometown, where she bumps into her school friend Oscar (Jason Sudeikis). He offers her a job in his bar and just when things start looking up for Gloria, in a bizarre turn of events, a monster surfaces in Seoul that supposedly mimics her mannerisms!<br>
<br>
<strong>Colossal </strong><strong>Review: </strong>Director/ writer Nacho Vigalondo’s Colossal is an oddball indie film that mysteriously unravels itself at its own pace, engaging you in the process. It’s a strange romcom that morphs into an unsettling drama and eventually, a sci-fi monster movie. An outlandish attempt at genre-bending cinema, Vigalondo’s absurdity makes sense if you choose to look beneath the surface and decode the metaphors. It essentially says, there’s a monster in all of us and we have to grow up at some point in our lives to face it.<br>
<br>
The film addresses the plight of 30-somethings in the form of Gloria, who is not ready for ‘adulthood’ as yet. She refuses to own up her drunken escapades and self-loathing. Her life’s a mess and so is her hair but her bigger concerns are her immediate comfort and thus a fault in her deflated mattress. You are intrigued by the film’s resistance to clichés even as it risks sounding inane.<br>
<br>
It’s refreshing to see good girl Anne Hathaway portraying this unapologetic character with peculiar quirks. But it’s Jason Sudeikis, who turns out to be a total revelation. Luring the audience into deconstructing his complex character is the film’s biggest asset. Dan Stevens, aka ‘the beast’ is perfectly cast as the smug elitist boyfriend.<br>
<br>
It takes a while to decipher what this weirdly unique film sets out to project. A preposterous ending doesn’t help either but if you like ambiguous storytelling, you might fancy this one. However, this could also be a colossal waste of time for you if you look for logic in cinema.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>To nurse a broken heart and stay away from the city chaos, Danielle, an artist, buys an old house on the countryside. But the house has all the qualities of creepiness and soon, Danielle starts ‘seeing’ the old occupants of the house, who have been dead for years.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Straight up, A Last Conjuring is a bad mix of some of the popular horror films of the recent times. It employs the typical shock techniques and element of surprise to frighten the viewer a few times, but that’s about it.<br>
<br>
Danielle (Jill Evyn) moves to a new house with the hope of establishing better focus at her work as an artist. The house, belonging to the Rosenberg family, has an eerie quality to it. A few days of staying there lead Danielle to believe that the spirit of one of the previous occupants, a young girl, still resides in the house. She then meets John (Lane Townsend), a local carpenter who doesn’t leave any opportunity to take his shirt off. John and Danielle hit it off but post a romantic date-night, John disappears. In the meantime, someone paints a Pentagram, believed to be an evil sign, in Danielle’s wardrobe, forcing her to believe that something bad is going to happen. Her fears come true when she is kidnapped and prepped for a human sacrifice.<br>
<br>
Before we even begin to make sense of the story, let us also tell you that there are so many loopholes in the plot that you lose count. For instance, Danielle starts having sleep issues and meets a psychiatrist who prescribes her mild sedatives, but a while later the same guy doubles up as a casting agent for Danielle’s friend. Amidst all the ghosts and black magic, there is the lead girl’s creepy jilted lover who has no qualms about stalking her and breaking into her house.<br>
<br>
The performances are sincere and there are some genuine scary scenes. But the Bidisha Chowdhury directorial appears to be a half-baked and hasty attempt at a genre that is gradually moving away from the age-old framework.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Five teenagers discover the Ranger Power Coins deep within a mine. The power of these coloured coins transforms them from outcasts to superheroes overnight. However, with power comes responsibility. The young warriors are assigned the task of saving mankind by defending Earth’s Zeo Crystal from a former Green Ranger gone rogue – Rita Repulsa and her gold giant Goldar. Mentoring the colour-coded Rangers are former Red Ranger Zordon and Alpha-5, the robot. Can they save the day?<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>A cinematic reboot of the 90s camp TV series, Power Rangers is an upgraded installment that predominantly caters to the kids. Sadly, it is way too cheesy, preachy, unexciting and dated to attract or inspire the youngsters. It is not a patch on its solid superhero contemporaries.<br>
<br>
Let alone luring fresh viewers, even diehard fans of the series may find this ‘morphin adventure’ (stands for ‘metamorphosis’ and not the drug morphine) underwhelming. While it makes tall promises and leads you on to believe something huge is in store for you, the climax in particular is a damp squib.<br>
<br>
The lead actors do a fine job, especially Naomi Scott (Pink Ranger) and Dacre Montgomery (Red Ranger) but the lacklustre execution fails to make you feel invested in their characters. From emotional drama to sci-fi to action, the genre-shifting narration is choppy and one heck of a bumpy ride. As a result, the film struggles to establish itself as a full-fledged superhero film. All you get is a drab 90’s costume drama (despite the absence of spandex bodysuits), hoping to look new.<br>
<br>
Elizabeth Banks is consciously over-the-top as Rita. Since there is nothing more to her than what you see, you desperately miss a strong antagonist. You don’t find yourself rooting for the Rangers even once and that’s a testament to its failure.<br>
<br>
Despite a decent cast, this unhurried reboot is way too ancient for your liking. It drains your power and patience with its constant moralistic lessons on importance of team work, punishing the bullies, dealing with repercussions of reckless behaviour, value of true friendship, etc.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Tim gets a new baby brother who wears a suit, secretly talks over the phone and draws up evil plans in the dead of the night.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Must animated movies border on the bizarre?<br>
<br>
The Boss Baby will test your threshold for quirky stories. In the realm of animation, nothing is too unreal: talking cars? Sure. Lost fish? Let’s give it a sequel. Emotions with their own emotions? Worthy of an Oscar. Add to that a baby who is a cunning corporate official, talks in pie-charts and is working relentlessly towards ridding the world of… puppies. See, bizarre!<br>
<br>
Tim (voiced by Miles Bakshi) watches in shock as his evil baby brother (voiced by Alec Baldwin) fools his parents (voiced by Jimmy Kimmel and Lisa Kudrow) into believing that he’s the adorable new addition to the family, while slyly planning a coup against the pet company that they work for. Puppies, baby’s research shows, are taking over the world with their cuteness and making babies obsolete.<br>
<br>
The film opens with a hilarious montage that shows where babies come from: a baby-manufacturing factory with assembly lines and everything. Most of them are assigned to a family, and some who aren’t cute enough are sent to work at this factory’s headquarters. All of this is prefaced by the fact that our protagonist Tim has a very vivid imagination. The whole movie could very well be an active fantasy of his. But whether it is real or not is left to the viewer.<br>
<br>
The writing is mostly fresh, sometimes infused with dry wit and will tickle you. There is some physical comedy, a lot of toilet humour and (thankfully uncensored) baby bottoms. The story itself turns into quite a cliche with an evil villain (voiced by Steve Buscemi) and a little boy with a saviour complex. Towards the end, there is some blatant emotional manipulation, but it isn’t too bothersome.<br>
<br>
This isn’t one of those films that are unnecessarily 3D; the animation is impressive and enhances the experience.<br>
<br>
Give it a shot, the storytelling isn’t strong enough to make you weep like a baby, but it will occasionally make you giggle like one.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>The Salesman </strong><strong>Story: </strong>Rana is assaulted in her new home, and while the attack exhausts her physically and emotionally, it is her husband Emad who spends sleepless nights toiling away in search of her faceless abuser.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Salesman </strong><strong>Review: </strong>In 1978, the Vinod Mehra - Rekha movie, Ghar, was said to be ahead of its time for depicting rape and its consequence on marriage. There too, two people move into a new apartment for a new start but their lives are brought to a grinding halt when the wife is gang-raped and the husband is left scrambling for answers.<br>
<br>
The Salesman briefly reminds you of Ghar, but quickly moves into unexplored territories. Here, the attack takes place within the house. Rana (Taraneh Alidoosti) is waiting for her husband to return home and casually unlocks the door for him before going into the loo to wash up. An unseen intruder breaks into the house and molests Rana. Her husband Emad (Shahab Hosseini) hears about the incident, and it opens the doors to a patriarchal sense of rage in him that he seemed to have locked away.<br>
<br>
The movie delivers on all the expectations one has come to attach with Asghar Farhadi's work. Like his previous breakout, A Separation, this is also a highly volatile story contained within the four walls of a house. No option for the characters but to bounce off the walls!<br>
<br>
The nervous energy of every character is palpable and makes you restless. The weight of the story shifts from the actual assault to its impact on the male ego seamlessly and you find yourself pondering a different social issue altogether. In the film, Emad plays Willy Loman (the titular character) in a local production of Death of a Salesman and soon finds himself in Loman’s shoes, approaching insanity in pursuit of a mirage.<br>
<br>
Taraneh Alidoosti’s vulnerability pierces your heart and you feel hurt on her behalf. Shahab Hosseini has been given a difficult role and walks the tightrope between being chauvinistic and compassionate.<br>
<br>
This Iranian drama is chock-full of intrigue and has a lot of parallels with Indian sensibilities. There are a lot of reasons to watch it, least of all the fact that it is this year’s Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language Film.

<strong>Chips Review :</strong> Just like 'Charlie's Angels' and the more recent, '21 Jump Street', 'CHIPs' is a film made in the same vein of films based on older, popular television shows.<br>
<br>
A buddy-comedy, it has Dax Sheppard playing officer John Baker, an ex-motocross champ who has fallen on hard times and is now a pill-popping, oldest rookie detective in the department. He is assigned to officer Frank 'Ponch' Poncherello (Michael Peña), a trigger-happy under cover FBI agent, who is tracking a bunch of crooked cops involved in high-speed heists.<br>
<br>
There may not be too many Indian fans of the earlier show. But for the ones catching it first time, there's not too much to get involved with. The action is decent, but nothing too hardcore. The violence is quite is real and there are some gory, yet darkly funny scenes. Like, when ponch has three of his fingers blown off, and Jonathan manages to retrieve only two as a maniac Ray Kurtz (Vincent D'Onofrio) sprays the ground around him with bullets.<br>
<br>
As far as the chemistry between the duo is concerned, there's not too much there. Between their bickering and chasing bad guys there's no real investigation going on and the case kind of opens itself up to them. While the story is weak, the humour occasionally salvages it, yet the misplaced homosexual jokes and the misogny make you cringe in places.<br>

Second - How did the studio manage to convince Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal - two certified A-list Hollywood actors - to star in it? And lastly, why is this still so entertaining? While the first two questions are best left for other forums, the third could be encapsulated by giving due credit to its screenwriters.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story</strong>: Samantha keeps reliving the day of her death over and over again, until she figures a way to break the cycle.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review</strong>: Can we be done with movies using Groundhog Day as a narrative tool, please? The idea of a person reliving the same day lost its novelty on February 13, 1993, a day after the Bill Murray-starrer hit theaters. It’s 2017 now, and we’re still being served the same cheap knock-offs, and we don’t know how to escape this loop.<br>
<br>
Just like Samantha (Deutch) doesn’t know how to escape her own Groundhog Day - the day of her death. Sam is your regular high-school girl with a blindingly stereotypical group of friends: the sassy mean girl (Sage), the drunk girl (Rahimi) and the Asian know-it-all (Wu). She wakes up on her judgement day, is mean to her parents, rides to school with her “baes”, breaks hearts, attends a party, gets into a fight, rides back home, meets with an accident and dies. Rinse and repeat.<br>
<br>
If you must tell a story where the character is living through the same day every day, must you make it such a drab day? Must the protagonist wear the same outfit every day? Must they fall into the predictable pattern of rebelling on one day, and being saintly on the next? Why is this story even worth telling? Before I Fall leaves you with more questions than answers.<br>
<br>
That said, the movie does talk about bullying and the importance of self worth. The concept is done-to-death, but handled with sensitivity. And Deutch’s performance makes you root for Sam, her heartbreaking eventuality aside. Some of the banter between the girls might even crack you up. If you’re a Gossip Girl fan, you may like the setting and take to the characters, unoriginal as they are.<br>
<br>
However, nothing can compensate for the fact that it’s a movie about repetition that is, unintentionally, highly repetitive.

Sadly, no matter how talented, since Kong is the king, he renders the A-list cast redundant. His only competition is the monstrous lizards aka skull crawlers and the two giants pretty much rule the roost and hog the screen space, literally and figuratively.<br>
<br>
Despite being clichéd, you enjoy the two species slugging it out in the jungle as the humans run helter-skelter, becoming the mere spectators. The CGI-fuelled action in 3D keeps you on the edge of your seat. Watching Kong smash a fleet of helicopters to the ground as we tend to crush mosquitoes is oddly entertaining. The witty repartee between characters makes up for the lack of depth and drama in the screenplay.<br>
<br>
While this instalment tries to match up to Peter Jackson's 2005 adventure, it lacks its epic cinematic moments, like Kong scaling the Empire State building. Though British actor Tom Hiddleston and Oscar winner Brie Larson have nothing much to do here except for gawking at the giants and running for their lives, they add credibility to this otherwise stereotypical franchise.<br>
<br>
Leading to the big Kong vs Godzilla (2020) clash, if you don’t mind some shallow, video game-esque entertainment, this one doesn’t disappoint.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>On April 15, 2013, two bombs exploded near the finish line of the annual Boston Marathon, killing three and injuring hundreds of people. The film chronicles the terror attack and its aftermath, comprising the week-long relentless investigation undertaken by the Boston Police and the FBI to hunt down prime suspects – brothers, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. It also salutes the spirit of Bostonians, who stood united in this moment of crisis.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>While all other characters are biographical, we see the film through the eyes of Police Sgt, Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg), who plays a fictional role. He is the patriotic Boston Police officer, who owes it to his city to find its culprits. How the cops and the FBI managed to nab Dzhokhar alive, along with the help of some brave citizens forms the story.<br>

<br>
<strong>Logan Review : </strong>After 17 years of playing one of the most popular characters in the X-Men franchise, Hugh Jackman (Wolverine/ Logan) naturally has a lot riding on his hunky shoulders in Logan — the third and last installment in the solo Wolverine series. Don’t expect to see the X-Men in all their glory because the characters have aged and been through the fires. Xavier’s declining mental and physical health (he’s in his 90s now) and Logan’s ageing body almost make us feel sorry for the two characters. While Logan earns a living by driving a limousine, getting drunk and getting into fights, Xavier's disintegrating mind compels him to stay sedated in order to keep his colossal psychic powers under control. The film has a lot of gory scenes — there’s plenty of bloodshed thanks to Logan’s notorious adamantium claws — so be prepared. But what shines through the action are the number of emotional moments between the lead characters, making it the most moving film of the franchise so far.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story:</strong> Superheroes-in-retirement band together to take down their own evil creator.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Take a bowlful of The Avengers, add a teaspoon of the Fantastic Four and sprinkle some X-Men superpowers for taste. And voila! You have Guardians — The Superheroes.<br>
<br>
Originality certainly isn’t this Russian superhero movie’s superpower. Ripped from the Marvel recipe books and following in the footsteps of The Avengers movies, this one starts out with a quasi-Frankenstein mad scientist, August Kuratov (Stanislav Shirin), who genetically modifies human beings to give them superpowers. He transforms Arsus (Panpushnyy) into a werebear, gives Khan (Madiyev) super speed, changes Ler (Sisak) into the lord of the rocks and makes Kseniya (Lanina) invisible. They’re painfully obvious versions of The Hulk, Quicksilver, Thing and Invisible Girl from various comics and movies.<br>
<br>
The story doesn’t put these Marvel-clones in new situations either. Predictably, mad scientist Kuratov is hungry for power and wants to control all the information satellites of the world; he even creates a lair in a high tower like a stereotypical supervillain is expected to. An intelligence agency, Patriots (S.H.I.E.L.D. anyone?), then finds the superhumans he created to beat him in his own game.<br>
<br>
The movie reluctantly checks the boxes that a superhero movie is supposed to: there’s decent camerawork, the actors look gorgeous, the villain is made scary, the visual effects are satisfactory and there’s an emotional backstory to every character, which is dutifully placed between explosions. But it is so similar to every other superhero movie you’ve seen, that you feel a perpetual sense of deja vu through its runtime.<br>
<br>
Watching these superheroes save the day will only slow down yours. Stay home and do a Marvel marathon instead.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Lion Story: </strong>Lion is an incredible real life story of Saroo Brierley, a 5-year-old Indian boy, who gets separated from his poor family. An empty train carriage drags him to Kolkata, a city that doesn't speak his language. Miles away from his home, braving human traffickers and child predators, he eventually gets adopted by a compassionate couple in Australia. 25 years later, recurring memory flashes of his childhood propel him to search for his lost home and birth mother in India, with the help of Google’s mapping program.<br>
<br>
<strong>Lion Review: </strong>Director Garth Davis' six Oscar nominated debut feature film is a gut-wrenching true story that tugs at your heartstrings. Do take a bunch of tissues along for this one's an absolute tear-jerker.<br>
<br>
While Dev Patel, as the older Saroo and Nicole Kidman, his Australian adoptive mother Sue, deserve the accolades they have been getting, it’s Sunny Pawar, who truly deserves an Oscar. He is ably supported by Abhishek Bharate, who plays his older brother Guddu. The kids’ undemonstrative performances, sans histrionics are noteworthy.<br>
<br>
What also makes this emotional roller coaster special is Luke Davies’ powerful adapted screenplay. Garth’s storytelling is equally compelling as he makes you see yourself in Saroo and endure his pain. The narrative evokes fear, concern and compassion without being preachy and that’s rare for a film of this genre. Lion has some minor hitches though. The second half gets sluggish and Rooney Mara’s irrelevance to the story interrupts the gripping narrative.<br>
<br>
While Sunny is the scene-stealer here, Dev and Nicole, prove their mettle as actors in a heartbreaking moment, that’s perhaps the best scene of the film. Tears trickle down your cheeks as Sue tells Saroo why she chose to adopt him when she could have had her own children.<br>
<br>
The cinematography and background score do justice to the film’s sensibility. Tannishtha Chatterjee and Nawazuddin Siddiqui make an impressive guest appearance.<br>
<br>
Sad yet uplifting, frightening yet inspirational, Lion breaks your heart into a thousand pieces and puts them back together in the end. It makes you believe in miracles and embrace hardships by celebrating courage and resilience in its own unique way.

The girls are perplexed by his motives as they witness his different personas – all they know is that they need to escape from this dangerous and unpredictable man.<br>
<br>
<strong>Split Review:</strong> ‘Split’ immerses you into the chilling world of its characters as they descend into their individual versions of hell. On one hand, is Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy) whose personas range from charming to downright menacing. Along with his therapist Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), we – the audience, underestimate the extent, and potential of his condition. Then there’s Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy), one of the three kidnapped girls with a genuinely horrifying backstory leading to a trademark Shyamalan twist ending.<br>
<br>
Anya Taylor-Joy is a revelation as an actress, displaying courage and heart-wrenching vulnerability as Casey. She would steal the limelight if not for a career-defining performance by James McAvoy. Kevin’s complex personas – each with their own nuances ranging from speech impediments to unique body language; which McAvoy pins down all the way to the twitches, results in an unsettling experience which sets ‘Split’ apart from others in its genre. However, the intricacy of the story makes for a deterrent – albeit essential to the eventual climax. There’s a fair amount of exposition about Kevin’s condition – dissociative identity disorder – which results in some uneven pacing in an otherwise exhilarating endeavour.<br>
<br>
Speaking of which – M. Night Shyamalan has suffered from an odd predicament; peaking early in his career with landmark films like ‘The Sixth Sense’, & ‘Unbreakable’, then fumbling the proverbial ball with entries like ‘The Village’. It’s commendable then, that the writer – director takes a calculated risk with ‘Split’, that pays off largely due to memorable performances inspired by a gripping, original story penned by himself that, surprisingly has a lot more to offer beyond this outing. If Shyamalan continues to bring his A-game to the big screen, he’s more than welcome to jump on the franchise bandwagon.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong>Director Martin Scorsese’s latest film ‘Silence’ revolves around the story of two Jesuit priests who travel to Japan as they seek to locate their mentor who is rumored to have apostatized.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> An adaptation of a Japanese novel of the same name, the central theme of ‘Silence’ is the exploration of faith — a personal experience unique to each individual. It’s of no surprise then, that it will prove to be a different outing for each viewer.<br>
<br>
From the very first frame, the beauty of this film’s cinematography is evident. Rodrigo Prieto’s Academy Award nomination is well deserved; there are some astounding shots that will make you wonder how they were blocked and lit. Even scenes depicting excruciating torture are interspersed with gorgeous landscapes and camerawork that compel you to be fixated through its lengthy runtime. Directors of photography will study this film for years to come, along with theologians who will have a field day with each character’s perspective of belief. The extent to which Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) is tested – mentally, physically and spiritually, is downright harrowing. Rodrigues and Father Francisco (Adam Driver), are put through hellish conditions as they try to find Father Ferriera (Liam Neeson) – the man who mentored them.<br>
<br>
Both Driver and Neeson have supporting roles that they do ample justice to, but it is Andrew Garfield who is tasked with all the heavy lifting. Although he struggles with the responsibility at times, Garfield is compelling enough as he ranges from dealing with his Messiah complex, to questioning the very nature of his faith as his prayers seem to fall on deaf ears. Besides these leading Hollywood actors, the rest of the cast is largely Japanese and each of them delivers a gripping performance – yet another testament to Scorsese’s calibre as a director. Another significant character is the soundtrack, or the lack thereof. Alluding to the title, silence has never been more deafening, especially during pivotal moments as your visual senses become more alert due to the lack of auditory input.<br>
<br>
Martin Scorsese invested over 25 years into this 'passion project' but he inadvertently alienates his audience on numerous occasions, largely due to some undeniable flaws in its narrative structure, and lengthy pacing that can be agonizing to casual moviegoers. Bound to result in polarizing opinions, ‘Silence’ is one of Scorsese’s most intimate works that cannot be ignored.<br>

<strong>Review:</strong> From the synopsis, it would appear this unusual yet alluring premise would be an intriguing watch. The initial setup is engrossing as it portrays the life of the first ‘genuine’ Martian. However, as soon as he lands on Earth, the sci-fi is relegated to fantasy as the lead pair embarks on a road trip, which doubles as an allegory for self-discovery – a tired trope that quickly loses steam. The narrative tries to juggle between what it means to be human, Elliot’s search for his father and his romance with Tulsa, but ends up focusing primarily on the latter.<br>

<strong>Kung Fu Yoga Review :</strong> At one point, Sonu Sood’s Randall is frustrated and says through his gritted teeth, “Don’t bore me…” as Chan’s character blabbers about morality. The line in itself is a short, crisp review of the movie.<br>
<br>
But if one must dive into details, Kung Fu Yoga is about Jack, one of China’s leading archeologists, who is enlisted by an Indian archeologist, Ashmita (Disha Patani), for finding a lost treasure that belonged to her ancestors. He comes to India along with his assistants Zhu (Yixing Zhang) and Nuomin(Miya Muqi) to unearth the mystery. But the treasure has another contender in Randall (Sonu Sood), who is equipped with a dozen kurta-clad white men, computer-animated zoo animals, sleek cars and a healthy dose of inherent greed.<br>
<br>
The movie begins so abruptly that you feel like you’ve started watching episode no. three of a show by mistake. Director Stanley Tong unloads a ton of information on you in the first ten minutes, leaving you half-confused and already half-disinterested.<br>
<br>
There’s some elementary-level Kung Fu and absolutely no yoga (but how else would India be represented in the title?); the English dubbing makes for awkward viewing and many lines seem to be lost in translation; there is altogether too much CGI work and to top it all, the movie sticks to a Western view of India (Elephants! Princesses clad in jewels! Temples! Snake Charmers!). It also has a strong Raiders Of The Lost Ark-meets-Temple Of Doom vibe.<br>

Chan seems to be restricted in his moves but still has his charm. Sonu Sood could have made for a better antagonist had he been badder. The nearest thing that the movie has to a quick repartee is not between any two characters but an interaction between Chan and a lion, which forces some giggles out of you.<br>

<strong>Plot: </strong>Alice returns to the birthplace of the zombie apocalypse to take a final stand against the evil Umbrella Corporation who is in its last leg to eradicate what is left of humanity.<br>

<strong>Review: </strong>The last installment in the billion dollar Resident Evil franchise, among one of the more successful game-to-movie adaptations, even though all movies have the same basic plot --- kill the zombies, survive the apocalypse, defeat the boss and escape with enough story to make a sequel. With Resident Evil: The Final Chapter, literally being the final chapter (though they leave it open-ended), does it deliver the goods to be the fitting finale to its 15 years long on screen journey? Not really, but it does come close.<br>
<br>
Leaner than the previous installments, this film has Alice (Milla Jovovich) has a mission to save the remaining 4,500 people on earth which the Umbrella Corporation means to destroy. The Red Queen, a double crossing supercomputer who has been a nemesis to Alice until now, actually helps her this time by telling her where she can get the only remaining vaccine to cure the undead within 48 hours. She teams up with her old friend Clare Redfield (Ali Larter)and other survivors and tells them of her plan --- to return to The Hive, release the anti-virus and kill her old enemies Wesker (Shawn Roberts) and Dr Alexander Isaacs (Iain Glen) --- all within 48 hours. As a result, we miss out on a lot of scenarios and the movie feels confined to just a few intense sequences. That being said, it’s a delight to see Alice escape by the skin of her teeth more than half a dozen times, with each of those close-shaves being truly thrilling, and the 3D makes them all the more exciting. The zombie-killing too has become a tad stylish than the previous installments and so have the weapons and the monsters.<br>
<br>
Its climax though, unravels so cleanly, that the build-up seems like a waste. However, at the end they leave enough of a story that you wonder whether the next movie in the franchise is a reboot or a sequel.

<strong>Matt Damon’s Chinese film debut (in English language), is as underwhelming as his last Jason Bourne movie.</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Story: </strong>While the ‘no ban no wall’ agenda has gripped the world in Trump regime, Matt Damon’s foray into Chinese cinema has him supporting ‘Nameless Order’, an elite Chinese army, who must defend the Great Wall of China from monstrous intruders, who descend from hell every 60 years. Set in ancient China and based on a legend, this fantastical action-adventure is Zhang Yimou’s first English-language production.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>“The wall stands or the world falls. Protect what’s yours”, is what this war epic essentially says, of course with no reference whatsoever to the current US-Mexico situation. Nevertheless, the film’s timing couldn’t have been more inappropriate as the story reveals why the wall was built. What adds to its predicament is its predictable plot, reminiscent of formulaic Hollywood blockbusters.<br>
<br>
The splendid use of vivid colours, imagery and Chinese background score initially get your hopes high but The Great Wall soon turns into a monster-slashing, CGI heavy, dated Hollywood potboiler with no soul. If you seek nothing more than popcorn entertainment and some visual thrill, this movie may do it for you but otherwise, it fails to amaze. While Yimou lets you get a glimpse of his unique vision, a standard script and his drive to please the global audience (predominantly mainstream Hollywood fans), affect his storytelling. You don’t get to experience anything new.<br>
<br>
Matt Damon’s Chinese film debut (in English language), is as underwhelming as his last Jason Bourne movie. He seems utterly uninvolved in his portrayal of mercenary-warrior William Garin, who gets captured in China during his quest for the precious ‘black powder’. Though a prisoner, his fighting skills earn him the respect of the colour-coded Chinese troops, who allow him to join their fight against the Taotie (monsters). His heroism not only saves China but also the mankind. The ‘westerners’ must save the world, after all, isn’t it?<br>
<br>
The Great Wall doesn’t have a single dull moment, thanks to the visuals in 3D. But if you seek something deeper, beyond the spectacle of fantasy war movie tropes, this one’s quite forgettable.

<strong>Story:</strong><br>
The film is an origin story of how an ambitious salesman called Ray Kroc turned McDonald's, a small town hamburger restaurant owned by the McDonald brothers into one of the biggest fast food restaurant chains in the world. His cut-throat strategies and sharp business acumen enabled him to put the brand on the global map, eventually even taking it away from the brothers (Dick and Mac McDonald), who originally founded it.

Persistence can overshadow talent if you refuse to think big, is what Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) firmly believes. He is a fading salesman, who sells milkshake machines and follows a motto that for any business, an increase in supply creates its own demand.

<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Being Russia’s highest-grossing film in 2016, ‘The Crew’ comes with great expectations. In an attempt to get the audience invested in its characters, the first half works towards building interpersonal relationships between three pilots. The male leads Danila and Vladmir, have both starred in Hollywood movies and their expertise shows. Danila plays his character Alex McCoy with sincere effervescence as the rookie pilot with a conscience who dares to defy seniority. However, his romance with Agne Grudtye’s Sandra is a damp squib, owing largely to Agne’s wooden and stereotypical turn as a career-driven pilot. Causing friction with Alex, Vladmir plays a steadfast yet weathered senior pilot who prefers to stick to the rulebook. The strained relationship with his wife and precocious son lends some comic relief to an otherwise somber film.<br>

<br>
<strong>xXx: Return of Xander Cage </strong><strong>Review: </strong><br>
Vin Diesel has a penchant for adding fuel to any franchise he’s attached to – if you’ll pardon the pun, and ‘xXx’ is no different. True to form, ‘xXx: Return of Xander Cage’ pushes the action to the max with extreme sports, gun fu, bike chases on land and on water, jumping off a plane with no parachute – to name only a few tropes. A treacherous villain, a sharpshooting sniper (Ruby Rose), a bumbling yet adorable hacker (Nina Dobrev), an enduring mentor (Samuel L.

"<div class='Normal'><strong>STORY </strong>: A popular college student unfriends an unknown girl on a social media website which unleashes a demonic entity that endangers all her friends and family.<br>
<br>
<strong>REVIEW </strong>: Tech-horror may just be a new genre to emerge, given the all-pervasive relation we share with technology. Still, do ghosts’ go digital? That’s the question you end up asking yourself, just like the protagonist Laura (Alycia Debnam-Carey), who finds it out the hard way when she accepts a random friend request from an unpopular girl Marina (Liesl Ahlers), who goes by the moniker Ma Rina with zero friends on a ‘popular social networking website’. A petty altercation with Marina ends up with her killing herself and posting the suicide video on Laura’s page. Then on, Ma Rina vows to kill all those close to Laura, digitally.<br>
<br>
Friend Request follows in the footsteps of the 2002 hit The Ring. While the latter had ghosts attacking through VHS tape, the ghosts in the former attack through cell phones, laptops and even printers. Other agents of the ghost are blue-eyed zombies and killer bees, but they appear ever so often, given the body count, that the VFX shocks end up being ineffective.<br>
<br>
Logic takes a hike, with a stabbed Laura running around for 20 minutes solving mysteries and a superior Matrix-level hacker being unable to get beyond the settings on the social media site, yet it’s entertaining. You end up following illogical plot points, and want to see just how the story ends. The pay-off is goofy, sure. But it’s still a good film to catch up on a late night with friends over.

<strong>Incarnate Review:</strong> Horror films, especially the ones about exorcism, tend to follow a similar pattern. A strong entity possesses a person. Enter a jaded exorcist who uses either technology, religion or a mix of the two to track and capture the ghost. And finally, what happens to the ghost, forms the storyline. So, when a film like Incarnate steps in, with promises of a different approach to pull out errant ghosts, your curiosity is piqued. Does the film live up to its claims of unique approach? Does it add to and open up more possibilities in the horror genre? Hardly.<br>

<strong>Sing </strong><strong>Review:</strong> Watching a musical with 85 classic songs may seem a daunting process. Especially one with animals as main characters, as there’s been a glut of that kind this year (Finding Dory, The Secret Life of Pets, Zootopia, etc.) Yet, the way music blends into the narrative is not only refreshing, but thoroughly enjoyable. Like all good musicals, the movie uses songs to drive the story forward. The characters are remarkably cute and stay with you long after the film ends.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> The title is a dead giveaway, and you’re fully aware of what you’re getting into. Surprisingly, the initial build up is brimming with promise primarily due to experienced comedians behind their characters. Jason Bateman, T.J. Miller, Kate McKinnon, Randall Park and Vanessa Bayer have become staples in iconic comedies and sitcoms. Jennifer Aniston’s tough-as-nails, no-nonsense, ‘horrible boss’ isn’t exactly unique but is played to perfection. Olivia Munn tends to be a wildcard, though her role here is suitably restrained.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Hands Of Stone </strong><strong>Story:</strong><br>
This is the true story of World boxing champion, Roberto Duran (Edgar Ramirez) who made his professional debut in 1968 as a 16-year-old and retired in 2002 when he was 50. In June 1980, he defeated Sugar Ray Leonard (Usher Raymond) to capture the welterweight title but shocked everyone in a rematch in November, the same year, by throwing in the towel, just like that.?<br>
<br>
<strong>Hands Of Stone</strong><strong> Review:</strong><br>
Like most biopics, this one typically depicts the rise and fall of a slum child of Panama; a boxing prodigy who goes on to win 22 of the 25 odd fights he participates in. Mentored by Ray Arcel (Robert De Niro), Duran who has 'hands of stone' invariably beats his opponents, winning countless titles in his 34-year-long career. However, this isn’t just one of those sport-dramas that don’t travel too far from the arena. The director insightfully captures Duran as the enfant terrible of boxing world and also showcases his prowess as a lover. Though slightly over-the-top, the film has heart. Juxtaposed against the tumultuous equation between Panama and the US, with the Panama Canal being a bone a contention, the plot cleverly runs through the emotions of an underdog nation that falls prey to America’s guile.<br>

With only two supporters - David (Theo James) and his father Thomas (Charles Dance), Selene seeks to stop the long-lasting war between Lycans and Vampires.<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>In 2003, the initial premise of pitting vampires against werewolves was exciting and successful enough to spark a string of sequels. However, this fifth entry in the 'Underworld' series proves that the franchise has run out of original ideas and is probably best left buried deep underground. Kate Beckinsale’s allure is largely squandered, and while she doesn’t appear to have aged a day since the first release, she certainly acts like it. None of the characters are given much complexity to work with, thereby wasting strong actors such as Tobias Menzies as the Lycan leader Marius along with Lara Pulver’s Semira, and although we see some sparks of quality shown by Charles Dance as the Vampire Elder Thomas, it's barely enough to salvage the film. It's almost as if the cold blue grading infected the entire cast and crew with a case of gloom – the script takes itself too seriously, without any humour that could have probably infused some entertainment value.<br>

<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic” quoted by Arthur C. Clarke (author, ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’), is the underlying mantra of this film, as it blends theories of consciousness with quantum physics to explain the mystical abilities of sorcery. The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has touched on this before with the ‘Thor’ series, but the science fiction is pushed a couple of notches higher to intergalactic heights here. And yet, there’s ample space and time for humour, visual gags, even some subtle slapstick that puts this entry well beyond some of its predecessors.<br>

<strong>Review: </strong>Modern zombie movies are usually associated with mindless gore, bucket loads of CGI and tedious scare tactics that can be spotted a mile away by the average horror fan.

<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>Tom Cruise’s second film in the series based on the popular books by Lee Child is more engaging than the previous one. It lends an emotional touch to what you expect from a standard action-crime caper. The film is replete with hard-hitting fistfights, lots of running around, quick chase sequences, ample gunshots, cheeky one-liners, and a plot laced with suspense and a father-daughter side story. In totality, it ticks all the genre-specific traits that you anticipate from it. Cruise even lets his charming self, take a backseat as he puts on the brooding persona of his character with elan.<br>

"<div class='Normal'><strong>Story: </strong> All might seem good to the eye but all is definitely not what it seems. In the case of this rather gripping tale, a widower, in rightful need of a new and better life, moves into a new hovel. He is not alone as he has his family with him in tow - a daughter and a wife, as the story goes. They settle in, seemingly simply. It does not take long for things go wrong for all of them. And the question is - should they stay or should they go?<br>
<br>
<strong>Review: </strong>There is a history behind the house that this family moves into. And it is but obvious as per the tenets of any haunted house horror film that deals with premise of a terrorized home. Think of the Amityville Horror. That legendary scary film that dealt with what a family had to handle in terms of a household terror.<br>
<br>
But mind you, this is not a typical horror film. You cannot keep out what is already within. It is not long before the smallest kid in the household stars experiencing instances of paranormal activity. The cinematography (James Kniest who has also worked on Annabelle) is tight, conveys the feeling of fear and will keep you on the edge of your seat, guessing about what is going to happen next. The special effects are subtle, and not the in-your-face variety. And yet, the atmosphere created by director Phil Claydon, manages to retain a tense scenario.<br>
<br>
It is definitely not entirely a dark film, in the sense that other suspense thrillers like It Follows and Babadook are. So basically, without giving away any spoilers, you will have to see this film to believe it. The sound effects are quite effective. Yes, indeed, there are jump scares. But those are not of the cliched variety that you will see in ordinary horror films. Here, the special effects team keeps matters understated.<br>
<br>
Phil Claydon has already made a name for himself in US TV and now, he has outdone himself here.

Dempsey’s character adds an interesting dimension to the story and you’ll find yourself wondering just who she will end up with. It’s clear that she has strong emotions for both the men, for their respective good qualities. Will it be the stiff upper lip lawyer Darcy (Firth is in fine form here, and really comes into his element in the second half of the movie) who also undeniably has strong feelings for her even though he is married to another woman? Or will it be the dashing and super-wealthy Jack, who is considerably more chilled out and easygoing than Darcy?<br>

The film also explores the aftermath of the event.<br>

<strong>Review: </strong>Early on in the movie, Sully tells his First Officer Jeff Skiles (Eckhart) that although he’s flown a million-odd passengers over a whopping 42 years, he now finds himself being judged for the decision and actions he took in just 208 seconds. It may just as well be though, for Sully’s successful landing of an Airbus A320 on the Hudson River would thereafter be hailed as the ‘Miracle on the Hudson’.<br>

<strong>Review: </strong>Jackie Chan is known for having made martial arts into an almost acrobatic form, as perfectly choreographed as a dance. Except that his rough-and-tumble maneuvers cause many bad guys to get their butts kicked. And you’ll see plenty of that here. Chan’s partner gets nabbed by the Chinese mafia early on in the movie. Before his partner perishes, he gives Chan his watch, asking him to look after his daughter (Fan). A promise that Chan swears to keep.<br>

<strong>Review: </strong>Right from the opening frame, Don’t Breathe gets into the heart of things with an ominous scene that looks straight out of a nightmare, but yet , is real-world enough. As for the rest of the movie, imagine a twisted version of Panic Room (where Jodie Foster rocked) and a very scary home-invasion story where it’s no big deal breaking into the house, but the heart-in-your-mouth factor comes from the fact that the three cannot get out.<br>
